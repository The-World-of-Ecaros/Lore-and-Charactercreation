The Badlands
============

### Topography

 The Badlands is a vast wasteland. The remnants of the once great elven empire, reduced to poisonous dust and erratic storms. Clean water is scarce, and food is found mostly in places where those few people—who remain—were able to survive. These locations are what still remains of the farmable land, despite this they still often have to hunt the dangerous creatures or commit acts of cannibalism to survive. 

### Government

 The Badlands have no established large government, with the only form such existing within the various tribes that roam its wastes. 

### Science / Magic Development

 The Badlands were previously a thriving empire of bio-magical engineering. Now the Badlands have been reduced to nothing but ash, dust and death. 

### Demographics

 Creatures like gnolls, orcs and desperate dark elves are the most common of these tribes but there are many forms of misery within this place. 

### Religion

 For those that still cling to religion within this hopeless place, it should be noted that the gods vary wildly. There are those that pray to the light and those that embrace the dark. In this land of famine and peril, all are welcome. 

### Military

 While war is no stranger to the Badlands, there are very few that could consider themselves to possess anything resembling a military. Most combat is tribal skirmishes that come to swift, brutal ends. 

### History

 Once, the badlands was a nearly utopic landscape, filled with plenty and majesty. That all changed when Synonine Twelvestar VII, was betrayed by his son. This one act ended the family line not only in it's governance, but also transformed the son into the first dark elf. The blight from that action spread into the earth, poisoning it and the transformation to what the Badlands is today was swift and merciless. Thousands died within the first few days, either from sickness and desperation. Thousands more from famine and neglect. The elves lost the seat of power and the struggle for what scraps remained fueled a war in Majital that would cost the elves their last home.  There was however a spark of hope. 60 years after the reckoning, there began an expedition from the elves that followed the old ways. They took the last of the imperial line, to attempt to take back their homeland. Their success is yet to be seen. 

### Economy

 The only real economy of the Badlands are the excavation and selling of ancient elven artifacts and corpses.
