Dolten
======

### Structure

Dolten's government is separated into two pieces, the public face of a council of nobles which run day to day operations; however, the true heart of the Doltenian government is a shadow government of witches of the Great Coven. Although this is supposedly a secret, it's a fact everyone knows but never speaks aloud.

### History

Dolten is a place rife with peril and mystery, it has always been so. Long ago in the first era when the forests of what would be called Dolten were formed, was home to the mighty Elunari great primordial dragons who fought over territory and hunted the animals in the old ways. It was during this time that the dragons from Dragonstar attacked, invaders swept over the sky and war came to Ecaros for the first time. The Elunari fought these invaders but most were slain resulting in the dragons being weakened; as such, both races spent centuries to recover while the elves began to spread their dominion. Dolten itself was forever changed by the blood of Elunari spilling into the earth. The forest grew more primal, its beasts began to warp and change. Woe'tanclast the white Elunari was perhaps the most impactful, for she was the wife and only love of Crovux father of Elunari it was from her blood which a single spider was swept up in the spider survived and was forever changed and with its survival one of Dolten's most notorious threats was born The Creeping Death. The lands of Dolten continued to be a place of danger and death all throughout the eras. That was until finally a group of desperate settlers paid the price to live there, in blood and will. It was from these first settlers and the witches that aided them, that the land was somewhat tamed allowing for civilization to against all odds thrive.

### Demography and Population

The population of Dolten is relatively diverse with a focus on humans, gnomes and elves. In addition to these Dolten is the primary home of skinwalkers and any race of which is difficult to look upon.

### Territories

Dolten is a temperate region, heavily forested with a swamp and a few large scattered rivers. The southern tip is a barren land of shale rock and alchemical industry.

### Military

The military branch of Dolten is controlled and manned nearly entirely by the Night Guard, they patrol the perimeter of the country and keep a constant look out from their fortress, the Crimson Citadel. The World Wanderers assist them intimately via the world roads through the deadly forests of Dolten.

### Technological Level

Dolten is a sporadically advancing nation in terms of scientific advancement. Parts still cling to the old tribal methods that they have practiced for centuries; this is especially true amongst the skinwalkers, some take to the full development of marble and stone and hope it will stand against the wrath of the forest. In Bleak the advancements rival that of even Khao, while their advances in planar binding rival that of even the old mages guild.

### Religion

The primary religions of Dolten are nearly entirely dominated by the Patrons beings with little form or dogma leading to a pseudo-spiritualism, of the dominant religions of the world the Green Pantheon is the most common.
