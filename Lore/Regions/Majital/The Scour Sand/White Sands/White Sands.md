The white sand desert stretches out across the southern coast of Majital, shining in the sun. Some have described the view as to see thousands of pearls glistening against the sea.

Palmed trees dot the horizon, on the edge of the sea and birds of the sea find refuge from the sun within thier fronds.

### Natural Resources

The white sand is as such, due to its high salt content, which is mined by the natives.
