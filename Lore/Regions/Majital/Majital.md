Technology is by no means stunted in Majital, but due to the presence of an abundance of arcane knowledge any technology serves to enhance magic.

### Religion

Majital has no official religion; however Runtheras, Cassius, Falaael and Raquel are commonly worshiped by the populace.

### Foreign Relations

Majital has a shaky standing with most of the countries in Aekrath. The tyranny of The Mages Guild of the 5th era are still fresh in the minds of the people and although there is not open disdain there is certainly watchful caution and in some cases a cold war.

### Agriculture & Industry

Majital has a few large salt mines that provide a productive economy and the Mage's Guild provides quite a bit of wealth with it's magical services.

### Trade & Transport

The Gold Road stretches to connect the other world roads all throughout Majital and with it the trade of salt, magic and mages spreads to the rest of Aekrath.

### Education

Majital boasts the highest literacy rate and education average of any of the countries of Aekrath. The Mages Guild has always treated the natives of the Scour with respect to maintain the peace, and see that they are educated and benefit from the bounties that arcane knowledge has provided.

### Infrastructure

Outside of Mirage there is very little infrastructure and with the exception of the Gold Road, no roads to follow, only the twists of the dunes.
