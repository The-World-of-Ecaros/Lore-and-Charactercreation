Steelfield
==========

A military academy for all manners of martial training, a prominent facility in which a small town has been constructed to support it.

### Demographics

Steelfield in the old days were largely Dwarfs and Humans. However the largest standing population is currently Half-orcs, who make up roughly 30% of the population. Followed by Dragonborn and Dwarfs.

### Government

Democratic/Assembly of Clans – Steelfield still makes many of it’s decisions in the old ways the previous tribes oversaw the settlement. Legislation can be put into review upon approval of 3 clans. At this stage, every clan will have to discuss internally if they are for or against the implementation. How each clan determines this has slight quirks and variances, but a general 60% agreement within a clans members will assure the clans yay or nay in the matter. Steelfield’s political landscape is composed of 8 total clans: Ornates Borrowed Jomudiar Fazun Bred-axe Wedgemen Cornovii Venicones There is also a ninth clan referred to as the “Pansophical“ which consists of only 8 members, who are all considered clean leaders in each other clan. They have the right to automatically enact and veto laws that have been put into review. They can also act as tie-breakers if the situation really calls for it, however ties have traditionally always been an automatic failure due to non-agreement and the Panisophical have yet to ever challenge this. though it should be noted that they do officially have this power. Each clan leader is also decided by each clan, who all have different customs and requirements to fill the role. This method makes for a very strong up-down political system with a stronger bottom-up. With the inclusion of the Dabroak Academy for martial training, the most recent clan, the Borrowed was founded. This clan makes up any foreigner who will be living, working, or studying abroad for longer than one year. Some foreigners can be “adopted” into other tribes, but this is more of a rare occasion than exception.

### Defences

Most of Daborak’s best horses come from Steelfield. Their Dragoons are the most respected Ecaros-wide, and most say there’s no better horse than one from Daborak. Their horses have been bred for years, and many Dragoons are trade in the old Steelfield ways of riding horses.

### Industry & Trade

While Horses make up the largest export in Steelfield, Barley and cattle food supplies are still a massive export, which still supplies 40% of export earnings, and take up nearly 20% of the labor force. The economy has been for awhile under a massive boost and it is expected that the animal husbandry market is going to continue growing in the future.    During the pre-unification of all city-states. Horse-trading was illegal in Steelfield, and normal punishment resulted in confiscation of your cattle and/or horses to your other clansmen, however this rule has since then been repealed. Despite the existence of trading horses, around 45% of the population are opposed to allowing trading of Steelfield-bred horses. There have been some locals who avoid businesses of those who trade with outsiders, but it’s unknown how much business is deterred.

### Infrastructure

Glory is the most popular deity and there are two small temples to him in Steelfield, one on Academy grounds and one in the town around it. There is additionally one temple to Iass, The Seven, and man-made channel devoted entirely to Astaroth.

### Assets

Steelfield have some of the fastest horses in Aekrath. The large tracts of grasslands and open fields have allowed for not only natural breeding grounds for stray horses, but also the most suited environment for training them as well. You can find many different breeds and famous trainers locally in Steelfield. Some of the highest-quality saddles and mounted armor also originate from Steelfield and are primarily only sourced here too. Though it should be noted all mounted equipment is primarily for Equine and Equine-like animals.

### History

Steelfield used to be a very minor power in the city-state era. While they back then still had the most feared cavalry, their numbers where their largest downfall. Many believe they would have been subjugated and forced into protectionism if it wasn’t for the horses barely shoving off threats. Many city-states eventually focused efforts on horse-raids and purposefully trying to preserve horses in battle, so they may have an efficient Calvary on their own. Little did they know that all the horses where signaled differently than other horses around the world. This made it nearly impossible for those trained otherwise to control the horses movements.  During the later years, during the Lizard Folk conquering lands, most of Steelfield was left in shambles, and almost non-existent. With no choice but to band together with other city-states, they were able to train a few others to use what little horses were left. When the Lizard Folk did not come back, there was a massive effort in funding Steelfield back to it’s former state. The government built a Calvary Academy, and for awhile was funding the town constructed around it. It wasn’t long before they were able to breed their horses back to fruition.

### Geography

Steelfield is built around what was an old tribe in the western-center of Daborak. The surrounding terrain is temperate grasslands, which is perfect for anyone traveling through the area, or expansion. The Grasslands nearby are also known for having a high volume of boulders and vertical slab, covered in writings and pictures. However, there is a lack of immediate access to wood, as there are no close forests nearby.

### Natural Resources

Steelfield has a generally cold temperate climate, though they will experience all four seasons. Winter will last longer, and generally leave the most impact compared to other seasons. While not always snowing, the season can bring in much rainfall and hail to wet the large tracts of land. Temperatures can get as low as −17F (−27.2C) or as hot as 86C (30C)
