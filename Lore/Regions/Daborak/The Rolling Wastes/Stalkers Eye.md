There are ancient temples dedicated to Sekelcuse that are still operated today. Many of the students at the academy go here for worship, as well as a handful of farmers and craftsmen. The most prominent worship are the temples to the green pantheon, due to the largest population of the town making up farmers who are hoping for green pastures and good weather.

Many craftsmen compete as having the “Unbreakable lock” and there are competitions hold each other year to put their locks to the test. There’s also a decent supply of spy gear at the academy, however there is limited knowledge of such devices, and it is only given to those agents.

### History

Stalkers Eye was originally just the small town it makes up. Full of twisted and evil bandits fighting for the mob rule. Many cutthroats and assassins plagued the constantly shifting political sphere. However, their superior scouting and reconnaissance abilities always gave their military an advantage. However, compared to the other city-states in Daborak, they had the smallest force.

### Geography

Stalkers Eye is located in Northern Daborak atop a small plateau. The strategic location allowed for easy surveillance of any large forces moving around in the area, with the only chances of being unseen are skittering among the few trees that lay below the plateau. There is also two small creeks distant to the plateau. Fools River, which runs from the west to the north, and Una creek, which takes a deep inward curve from the west to south-west.

### Natural Resources

Slightly higher above the ground, the air is more dry, and the atmosphere just a little thinner than normal. Due to the lack of humidity, rain, clouds, and fog are an uncommon site. Though snow is often heavy and harsh in the colder seasons. The temperatures sit around anywhere between -10F to 80F, depending on the season. The elevated position also assists with drainage, and the wind will sometimes break harshly against the plateau. Despite this, the erosion seems to not affect the landscape as severe as one would assume.
