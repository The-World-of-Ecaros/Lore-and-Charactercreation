Blackwheel
==========

### Demographics

Total population: 3500 Humans: 55% Halfling: 25% Elven blood: 10% Dwarfs: 5% Other: 5%

### Government

Blackwheel uses the typical feudal lord government structure with additional oversight by a Daborak military commissar. In the wake of the undead uprising and Kingvale’s defeat, the treasonous Lord Malfous was replaced by the war hero Branwyn. Branwyn’s rulings and actions are closely overseen and authorized by the commissar Lt. Johan Wilderburg of the Daborak Cavalry. Malfous loyalists may still be involved in lesser aspects of the government and some suggest that Branwyn is a sacrificial lamb put in place to draw out would be assassins.

### Defences

Branwyn is no slouch when it comes to combat, and definitely not one to let honor come between himself and victory. He leads about a hundred battle hardened veterans from the Uprising.  The Commissar is in charge of a detail of 12 knights and their retinue as well.

### Industry & Trade

Foodstuffs, grain, farming and cattle are all the big industry of Blackwheel. It acts as a central processing location and shipping hub for the region.

### Infrastructure

Most of the surrounding population follows the Green Pantheon, seasonally as appropriate. Green holidays and festivals occur at a small park where the aqueduct drains what is left from the system. The bias towards Silloway only exists because farmers can more readily participate when they bring their crops to market.  The Knights defending Blackwheel have their own Chapel to Glory in a confiscated manor or a treasonous lord. The goodwill of the people stems from their defense during the Undead Uprising. However, familiarity breeds contempt and the opinions have been moving more towards “What have you done for us lately?”  Iass is worshipped more openly by the rank and file of the military as well as Branwyn himself. They hold services when they can and in response to small victories. Services are held at a tavern which some claim is more of a pit fighting ring. The beer is locally brewed and bitter, about the only good thing about it is that the hangovers are exceptionally mild.

### Assets

Blackwheel has some more advanced engineering regarding the use of the river as power and irrigation. This is largely taking advantage of the eponymous black water wheel built after the Reckoning and in conjunction with Ordean engineers. The 60’ diameter water wheel drives the main shaft, which in turn powers the primary mill as well as several other small industries nearby as well. The wheel also raises water high to an Ordean style aqueduct. Although the aqueduct was originally intended to feed the surrounding farms, once it got to the lord’s manor, the project was deemed not financially feasible and construction stopped. The lord’s manor and buildings closer to the wheel do have indoor plumbing though.  A secondary industry, formed after the Undead Uprising, has developed in spy craft. The commissar uses Blackwheel as a practical training ground for Daborakian military intelligence, primarily for sniffing out insurrectionists.

### History

Prior to the Reckoning, the area around Blackwheel was just a couple of farms taking advantage of the river. As an experiment and proof of concept, the building of the water wheel was authorized and the settlement grew around the construction. It became a food production center for northern Daborak until the recent Undead Uprising when it was discovered that the local lord was a traitor to the crown. Blackwheel is under new management now, if not occupied by the Daborak military until such time as they are certain the insurrection has been completely squashed.

### Geography

Blackwheel is a medium sized settlement along the Equus River in Northern Daborak. The surrounding land is verdant fields and ranches used to feed the armies of Daborak.
