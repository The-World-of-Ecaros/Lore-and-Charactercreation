Ramon's Roost
=============

### Demographics

Most of the three-thousand (3,000) people living within the city are human, with a smaller percentage of half-orc and half-elf citizenry. Other races living within are of a much smaller percentage.

### Government

Like the rest of Daborak, Ramon’s Roost is under the control of the military and they have a noticeable presence within. Other than that the people with the most power in the city are the owners of the three taverns that vye for superiority.

### Defences

The military presence in Ramon’s Roost is noticeable, but not inherently pronounced. It is a common stop for many travellers in the area, and as such has enough military personnel that it can adequately keep the city safe—that number swells to almost 8 times its size when the need arises.

### Industry & Trade

Most of the income in the city comes from the three taverns residing in it. They generate gold and spend it in the markets and also use it to pay their workers. There are various stores within the city. This includes a small marketplace where one can buy clothes, food, materials, and other such items; however, they pale in comparison to the taverns that demand the spotlight. During the festival every person living in the city sees a sudden growth of the money flowing in and out of both their own pockets, and those of visitors.

### Infrastructure

As with the rest of the country, the city is primarily made up of worshipers of Glory and the Grey Pantheon, Iass being the most common of the group. The city does however have a noticeable presence of Green Pantheon worshippers, specifically those that worship Vinsc in the hope that Lord Autumn would aid in their harvests.

### Assets

Ramon’s Roost is a simple town, with simple practices. It is not a place you would go for developments of the scientific or magical nature; though there is speculation that magic is used in the creation of the various beverages that are served at the taverns for which the city is well known.

### History

Ramon’s Roost came from humble beginnings; a tavern that had been built during the time just after Daborak’s city states had driven back the invading Lizardfolk. It was a place of rest for travellers, soldiers, and adventurers alike. Since then the town has sprung up around it, with the main road leading through it still passing by this tavern. The problem, however, lies in that there are three taverns in the city—each vying for supremacy with their beverages. And each of them claim that they are the original tavern, which only adds to the confusion and to the rivalry. These taverns have become so well known that there is a yearly national festival dedicated to the drinks that they serve, and the population of the city during this time swells from the 3,000 regular residents to a staggering 20,000. The taverns are Janicki's Jack, Crosseyed Mule, and Poppys Port in the Storm Pop. Each tavern serves their own unique and distinct alcohol and beverage. One of the more well known—though not necessarily enough to claim without a shadow of a doubt that it is superior—is Uncle Poppy’s Elixir of Everything, served at Poppys Port in the Storm Pop. It is supposedly so potent and delectable that a single drink is enough to cause the drinker to become addicted to it. This is rumored to be because of the rare ingredients used to create the drink, and one of those is whispered to be the tears of an angel. Of course there has never been any definitive proof of this brought forth, and Poppy, the owner of the tavern would be the first to deny that rumor. Though it has not stopped it from festering.

### Geography

Located in Southeastern Daborak, Ramon’s Roost is a city nestled within temperate grasslands and rolling hills. The nearby river helps to provide fresh water for the people and the animals that live within, and for the farms that are on the outskirts of the city. The actual city itself is of moderate size, with a noticeable amount of space that is unused.
