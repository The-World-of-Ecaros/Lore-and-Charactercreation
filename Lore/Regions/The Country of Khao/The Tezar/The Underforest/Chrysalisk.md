Chrysalisk
==========

When the Ii’tanas collapsed, some of their splendour and extravagance escaped from their lands and made its way to Khao. The crystalline insect was once a symbol of wealth and prosperity, and when the lizardfolk of Khao discovered it’s corpse it became a source of wealth and prosperity from those who settled within and began to mine its bones for gems. Due to raids from outsiders wanting to take the wealth of Chrysalisk for themselves, the village of Chrysalisk is insular and distrustful of outsiders.

### Demographics

Chrysalisk is a bustling village with a population of approximately 4,000. The population consists almost entirely of saurians and kobolds. Due to the remote nature of the village and the hostile environment of the surrounding jungle, there is very little immigration or emigration in the insular society of the city. The wealth of the mines is closely guarded by its residents, and outsiders are not usually welcomed within.

### Government

Society in Chrysalisk is tribal in nature, and the oldest and most venerable of its residents rise to the top of the tribal hierarchy and rule the village.

### Defences

Tribal warriors amongst the residents of Chrysalisk protect the village from the hostile fauna of the Khaon jungle and the occasional bandit raid. Chrysalisk is relatively peaceful; it is rare that the warriors are called upon to defend the village, and most of their time—when they are called— it is to goes to hunting to provide for the village, as well as protecting the occasional convoy.

### Industry & Trade

The wealth of Chrysalisk lies in the gems that can be mined from its insectoid foundation. Traces of residual Ii’tanas magic still linger in the gems, and they fetch a pretty price in the city of Khao. As the village itself is very secretive and insular, monthly trading convoys will make their way out of the village and travel for weeks to the nearest trading post, where their prearranged contact with the Great Bazaar will exchange the gems for gold and luxurious supplies that are not easily procured within the village.

### Infrastructure

The gems of Chrysalisk still contain latent magic from the age of the Ii’tanas and are sought after by researchers and collectors alike. There are a few residents of the village that are more versed in the arcane and study the crystals themselves, but the majority of magics in Chrysalisk are druidic in nature—used by tribal shamans to run the day-to-day affairs of the village.

### Assets

While there is no organized religion present in the city, many of the residents worship Lorn and make devotions in the private of their own homes. In the kobold district of the village, there is a hidden shrine to The Seven, where many of the diminutive lizardfolk go to worship one of their own.

### Geography

Within the giant crystalline corpse of an insect lies a large village in the jungles of Western Khao. The surrounding flora has overgrown the area, and it is not until one passes through the painstakingly maintained tunnel into the village that one can see the abundant wealth lying within.
