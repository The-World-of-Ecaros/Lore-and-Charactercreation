### Government

Council of Marble:  9 person council with an equal vote on all legal matters  Majority votes on major settlement issues, along with legal cases raised to their judgment from the basic courts of Radiance  Smaller civil matters are handled by an array of judges, juries and barristers. Business matters tend to be managed by the myriad of trade guilds which are loosely affiliated with The Great Bazaar.

### Defences

Radiance has a city guard which also serves as a standing militia (reinforced by a citizen reserve) called the Silver Sentinels, which provides basic day to day security. In the event of an actual war they would rely on the Order of the White Council, which would have the Silver Sentinels folded into it.

### Industry & Trade

Radiance is known by the common may as the 'rich part' of Orde, and this oversimplification is not without merit. Radiance produces an abundance of silver and jewels from its mines, and the marble from their quarries is second to none. Their smiths focus less on weapons and armor but more on fine jewelry and artwork. It is known, particularly by the holy men and women of Aekrath, that Radiance is one of the rare few places actually capable of producing diamond dust. Naturally, this makes it a critical location for The Council of Lightâ€”Orde would do much to make sure it is secured.

### Assets

The city does not place a large degree of focus on magical development except when it applies to mining, quarrying, and metallurgy. Magic is regularly employed to make sure trade is fair. The science of Radiance is primarily focused on improving technologies for mining silver and precious gems, better refinement of these raw materials, and securing the physical safety of those who mine and quarry.

### Guilds and Factions

Radiance primarily follows the White Pantheon as well as the Grey Pantheon. The only Grey Pantheon member not given some measure of respect is Sekelkuse. They do not primarily worship the Green Pantheon, but have nothing against it's worship.

### History

Radiance is one of the oldest cities in Orde, founded shortly after the capital. In their search for strong iron and stone to make arms and shelter, the early Ordeans instead found massive amounts of silver and incredible marble. The founding of Radiance has shaped the growth of Orde drastically, as it is both a provider of economic capital and raw resources.

### Geography

Radiance is mostly flatlands that edge into large mines and quarries. Due to its location at the tip of the White-Gold River, it also has access to running water and the benefits that come with.
