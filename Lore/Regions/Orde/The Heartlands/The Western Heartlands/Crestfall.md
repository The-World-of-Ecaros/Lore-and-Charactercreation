Crestfall
=========

Crestfall is the capital city of Orde and is the shining pearl of the country.

### Demographics

Humans and half-elves number slightly more than the other goodly races, with the monstrous ones, being all but absent within this holy city. The city's vanity has led to many of the less 'pretty' races to feel a slight social prejudice, enough that they choose to live elsewhere most of the time.

### Government

Crestfall is the seat of government for all of Orde and it is where the White Council can be found. Although the White Council is the ruling body of all of Orde, Crestfall has its day to day operations overseen by bishops of the various religions that dominate the city. This has led to some, albeit minor disagreements among the faithful of the White Pantheon but regardless the city lives in a reasonable peace and gratuitous prosperity.

### Defences

The military arm of Crestfall is the same as all of Orde, it is protected by the Order of the White Council; although the honor guard of this force, The Alabaster Knights, guard Crestfall itself.

### Industry & Trade

Crestfall depends much of its economy on the taxes and tithes it receives throughout the country. The city itself has a trade market but it is not sufficient to sustain the city; therefore, The White Council makes great strides to maintain good relations with the other cities in Orde

### Infrastructure

Crestfall is the jewel of Orde, a glittering white marble city, with massive aqueducts that provide a power source as well as a water source for the shimmering city. Constantly maintained divine blessings, has all but eliminated sickness and the White Pantheon has blessed many aspects of life for those that live within Crestfall; as such, many of citizens are pious—to differing degrees.

### History

Formed by the refugees of the fall of the Elven Empire, The White Council forged itself to protect the ideals they were denied by their elven masters. It is ironic that this in and of itself, causes a mistrust of sinister things and the prejudice there-in. The Reckoning shook all of Orde to its core, with it the White Council began to question many of its outlooks. Due to a lack of leadership and the pure devastation wrought by the Reckoning, led many to fall back into old and familiar ways. Even now—a generation after those events—while buildings may have been repaired, the memories of what was lost remains heavy. As such, The White Council sought to once again awaken the Inquisition, to hold off any further attack from unseen places.  Crestfall has been anointed by many of the high priests of the White Pantheon. These are not only what ward the city from attack, but also what guards its people against disease and famine. However, no other deity matches the influence over Crestfall than that of the Seven. The seven pointed star can be seen in all its majesty from the cathedral of hope in the center of the city.
