### Government

#### Ships Court

This high court of Fireport includes the (currently 7) largest ship captains (or their appointed) representatives and 3 bishops of the white or grey faiths appointed by the Council of Light. One of these bishops is always a priest of Khaeeli, though her worship does not usually go in lock-step with normal beliefs of Orde.  
  
Each of the captains gets a vote on all Fireport-wide affecting measures, with the 3 bishops as support. If there is ever a tie, the tie is always broken by the bishops. The bishop of Khaleeli can choose to enact a super-vote in the tie breaking scenario; if they choose to do so it is tradition that they step down. The Ships Court usually follows the wisdom of the Khaleeli bishop, so this is a truly rare occurrence. Smaller civil matters handled by an array of judges, juries and barristers. Business matters tend to be managed by the myriad of trade guilds which are loosely affiliated with The Great Bazaar.

### Defences

Fireport is protected by the Naval Guard, a force commanded by some senior officials of the Army of Light combined with full time citizen soldier-guards, mercenaries, citizen reserves—and in times of true danger—the sailors residing in the city who wish to defend their ships against danger.  
  
It is rumored that, in times of true crisis, the Undercity could deploy quite the formidable army of mercenaries and killers to defend itself. However, such an event has yet to occur. But when vigilante murders and assassinations happen, suspicious eyes always turn to the Undercity.

### Industry & Trade

Fireport is not considered wealthy in the traditional sense. It is a practical port town, and little is afforded towards the luxuries of wealth. Some luxury lodgings and restaurants exist—as close as possible to the most peaceful parts of the sea—where the nobility and the upper-class can be pampered with delicious food, delicate massages and comfortable beds. Of course, some merchandise can be found here of a luxury nature—being a port town. However, for the most part, it's a shipping town. Most goods are not meant for here, and most who work and travel here are honest enough folk doing business.  
​​​​​​​  
However, a booming black market exists in the Undercity of Fireport for those clever and resilient enough to find it. Goods nicked from the surface above or taken from other places, little is off-limits here—though all sales are costly. Though the Undercity is dank, shadowy, and crumbling, those in good with the right people live merrily off of skimmed riches and possibly even the slightest bit of noble bearing. A dark and mocking mirror of the glinting silver light of Orde.

### Assets

The city does not place a large degree of focus on magical or scientific development except when it applies to maritime affairs and ensuring that trade is fair and honest. Great efforts are made in these areas in order to root out and detect those of the Undercity that plot nefarious futures for Fireport and Orde. Since Fireport is the recipient and/or owner of the largest maritime vessels on the continent, a great deal of time, manpower, magic and money is invested in perfecting the maritime arts and ensuring that Orde can continue to dominate the seas—including their trade wars against Majitalian sailors and their literal wars against the pirates of Bloodwave Bay and elsewhere.

### Guilds and Factions

Radiance primarily follows the White Pantheon as well as the Grey Pantheon. There are more worshippers of the Green Pantheon here due to the life of a sailor, and this is the rare place in Orde where Khaleeli worship is openly displayed and praised. Of note, the largest church to Glory sits within Fireport; though it is not the main church of Glory it is considered a pillar of the faith.  
  
Pretty much all faiths can be found in the Undercity. However, in the most hidden parts of the Undercity, the Theives Guild raise glad prayers and cups to Sekelkuse as they defiantly continue his noble and merciful work.

### History

Fireport's history is long and convoluted, and little formally exists. Fireport has been torn apart by war, trade disputes, crime and the Reckoning. Rumors fly about wildly, some even claiming that a God died within Fireport. Still, the citizens of this city put little stock in these tales. After all, they are sailors always looking towards the horizon. Fireport stood yesterday, it stands today, and will stand tomorrow.

### Geography

Situated on the southern lip of Orde, the city has access to the open sea and otherwise enjoys a good amount of (naturally or artificially) flat land. However, they rely on outside cities and towns for most of their food, as they have little access to suitable planting/ranching space. A good section of Fireport, fairly close to the main city is both naturally and artificially raised. This serves as a hub for airships to land, refuel and load/unload.  
  
However, Fireport is an old city with a vibrant history of war and tragedy. Fireport sits atop a great and cavernous Undercity, remnants of an old Fireport. Here a thriving culture of both villains and vigilantes can be found. Villains, hiding out from the authorities of Orde as best as they can, as well as those who bring justice in a way the Council of Light would never approve. It is rumored that somewhere in this Undercity lives the Ledgerdomain, guildmaster of the fabled and nearly ruined Theive's Guild. Still working to bend things to his end even as he digs himself and his people out of the rubble.
