Jordans Rest
============

A testament to a saint of the past Jordan's Rest is a quiet place, welcome to all.

### Demographics

The racial spread in this settlement is almost everchanging. It is still reflective of the general demographic of Orde, but it however somehow displays an even greater spread of races. The average age is much lower than almost anywhere else in Orde, specifically since the leadership there is most commonly formed of young adventurers who came back here to settle down. There is not a single race who is seen poorly in Jordans Rest as all of them are together in hardship. Most of the older residents are religiously inclined.

### Government

The leadership of this settlement is diplomatic. More often than not, orphans who grew up in Jordans Rest come back later in life in order to give back and help others just like they have been helped. The leadership is usually filled with people trusted and admired by those who got to know them during the time they spent as orphans.

### Defences

The militia of Jordans Rest is strong and fierce. It is mostly made of battle tested adventurers who came from Jordans Rest and came back to protect what it stands for now that they were ready to settle. This place means everything to them, as every townsman is family. There are also many clerics and paladins who are more martially inclined that decided to dedicate their life for the protection of orphans. The strength of this militia added to the fact that the population of the settlement is usually low means that they rarely need help from Orde's military.

### Industry & Trade

Jordans Rest is an interesting area in terms of economy. On paper it is a net negative for the region of Orde. However, it provides something that is invaluable: adventurers. The ratio of adventurer to population is the highest of anywhere else in Orde as it is often the path that orphans choose to take. This is a place where young talent blooms and is cultivated instead of being lost and forgotten. It is a place where hope and faith gets deeply ingrained in future generations. There are no amount of gold pieces in the world that could replace such a thing, and this is why the settlement remains even if it relies on external funds and supplies.

### Assets

Jordans Rest is surprisingly a good area for development in both magic and science. The orphans who are sent there are greatly encouraged to find a calling in life in order to find a place of their own in this world. Because of this, their aptitude is tested and monitored. When there is a big spike of magically or scientifically gifted orphans, special schools open their doors. It is not rare for the settlement to house a prodigy or two who may advance their specific field.

### Guilds and Factions

Jodans Rest is dedicated to the patron saint of orphans: Jordan. This man is almost as praised as the gods themselves, as he embodies everything that the residents of this settlement uphold. On top of this, it is quite the religious place since many orphans find hope through faith. Many followers of multiple deities travel to Jordans Rest in order to provide support and hope to the orphans.

### History

One simply can't walk into Jordans Rest without being enveloped in the history of the settlement. All around the settlement are ghosts of the past, abandoned camps from darker times when orphans came in the thousands. Times like The Reckoning made the population explode for all the wrong reasons but this area was chosen specifically to allow this. The population decided to leave the camps up for both efficiency reasons and to remind everyone their purpose.  Many of the adventurers who come from Jordans Rest tear up a piece of cloth from the abandoned camps and proudly tie it on a piece of armor or on their clothing to show appartenance.

### Geography

Jordans Rest is mostly flat. The location was chosen because the settlement needs room for expanding if the need would be. However, the lands are not very good for agriculture and the trees are scarce. The settlement relies on outside help a lot for sustenance. The center of the settlement is an abbey which is Jordans Rest main focus.
