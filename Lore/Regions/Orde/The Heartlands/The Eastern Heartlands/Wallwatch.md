Wallwatch
=========

Wallwatch is a city of welcoming arms which stands as a testament to the resistance against the tyranny of the past.

### Demographics

Due to its proximity to the Badlands, Watchwall is the most culturally tolerant and accepting of all of Orde's cities. As many tribes of orks, tieflings, goblinoids, and others would be 'undesirables' by Ordean standards flee here to hide from the horrors of the Badlands or from the oppressive prejudice of Orde. That is not to say that they find welcome here, merely that they are more tolerated than elsewhere in Orde. As it pertains to religion The White Pantheon and all the deities find Wallwatch home for their various churches. Many deities from the gray pantheon also find home here, yet rumors of less sanctioned churches and cults constantly draw the eye of the Inquisition.

### Government

Although on paper Wallwatch is ruled by the appointed Bishop Peyo Le Bail, the truth of the matter is quite apparent to anyone who steps foot within the walled city. The Wall Watch is the true power here, and the Watch Wall commander is the final authority within Wallwatch. A small city council handles mundane day-to-day affairs that concern the lives of the citizens, only involving the Commander when a threat to the city arises which happens more often than anyone would like.

### Defences

Wallwatch has an extremely strong military presence consisting almost entirely of the Wall Watch. In addition to being extremely well armed, trained, and numerous. They also have various watchtowers, forward outposts, and strongholds scattered throughout the nearby area; thus making an organized assault on the wall costly at best, suicidal at best.

### Industry & Trade

Wallwatch's economic foundation is production and tourism based. Although Wallwatch has little in natural resources, the amount of quality weaponry and armor produced at its forges are exported and sold all over Orde.  Additionally, due to its close proximity to the Badlands. Wallwatch is the first and last destination of any expedition to the Badlands. As such many adventurers not only spend their hard earned coin to what may be their last night in civilization, but also the first place they will attempt to pawn off and exchange any treasures recovered.  Although Wallwatch is for the most part self-sustaining due to the farms on the fertile soil on its fringes, the yield is not great enough that a famine is without risk and therefore relies on the rest of Orde to keep them supplied should any disasters strike the farms.

### Assets

Wallwatch is at the forefront of Ordean military technology development. Being the first and greatest front against the horrors of the Badlands. Constant alchemical research is conducted within the various academies to find oils to combat their foes and remedies to combat their maladies. Three great forges constructed into the wall roar and blaze with glorious fires as hammers and sweat drops in equal measure to construct mastercrafted gear to arm the soldiers of the Watch Wall.

### History

Wallwatch is the oldest city in Orde primarily because it predates Orde itself. As refugees marched westwards from the fall of the elven empire, some had found stay at the first stop outside of what one day will be known as the Badlands. Known only as "the first settlers" these men and women joined together with what was at the time a small but welcoming elven hamlet to build the great fortifications that would eventually grow to become the hallmark of the city. The elven contribution to this, like most non-human contributions, was quickly forgotten by the Ordeans. In time the standard Ordean marble flooring began to cover the streets and traces of elven architecture slowly disappeared. What elven architecture does still exist was simply attributed to "the first settlers". Even the stolen great Jade Fortress within the Inner Sanctum of Wallwatch, which rightfully bears the markings of Elven Craftsmanship as the statues within are grown from the Jade rather than carved, is commonly believed by the locals to be the construction of "the first settlers".

### Geography

Wallwatch has a dry and arid climate with sweltering hot summers and incredibly cold (but snowless) winters. Although the land in the immediate vicinity of Wallwatch makes for poor farmland, the land on the fringes—especially bordering the river—possess fairly fertile and rich soil. As by its namesake Wallwatch is constructed on the Ordean side of the Wall that bisects Orde and the Badlands.
