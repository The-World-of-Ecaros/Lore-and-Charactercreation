Fioras Mirror
=============

A floating settlement atop a hallowed lake.

### Demographics

The census of Fioras consists mostly of humans, elves, aarakocra, and even triton due to migrations from the sea.

### Government

Theocracy / The White Council, rules the land and makes most decisions based on the collective of holy documents from the faiths of the White Pantheon and a procedure of voting.

### Defences

While paladins are the main source of strategic power within Orde, Fioras must rely on their naval forces. The shipyards, while small, always seem to be readying military ships. While the ships are not big—due to being confined to a lake—they make up for in size with speed; easily transporting troops across the water, be it for boarding an enemy ship or bringing them to land to join the fight.

### Industry & Trade

While Radiance is prominent in marble and jewels Fioras Mirror is mostly recognized for its expensive and top quality seafood due to being close to the Sickened Sea and itself being a city lain on the water.

### Assets

Fioras Mirror is very magic orientated (with the exception of unholy magics), but they are not opposed to technological advances that can help support the floating city such as installing poles into the lake floor and attaching them to platforms to hold the buildings up.

### Guilds and Factions

Runethisians are prominent within the city, seeking knowledge to ever improve their ways of life upon the mirror lake. The Church of Runethares is one of the largest buildings in Fioras Mirror.

### History

Upon the exploration of Orde it is rumored a crew of sailors braved the Abyssal Sea but were met with a ravenous storm that tore their ship apart flinging them into the water. Many crew members were lost but those that Kaheeli touched were carried down the rivers of Orde. The crew's captain woke on the shore of Fioras, dazed and grateful that he and some of his crew survived. After he and the crew came to they started to notice each one of them bore shimmering scales upon some part of their body. What happened beyond that is all rumors and folklore but it is said that the crew turned to the lake to see a woman descending into the water with a smile on her lips…

### Geography

Fioras Mirror is a minor settlement found floating atop a large reflective lake, so reflective that the town itself looks as if it brought the sky down to the earth below. The town's architecture has been made specifically to float atop the lake; utilizing magical air to fill dense cloth balloons strapped to the sides of the platforms the buildings reside on. A large shipping dock can easily be seen protruding from the island settlement, ships venturing the lake seem to skim across the liquid rather than tear the water apart.
