Pallors Fog
===========

A quiet town, built within the plateau of natural stone in which the Wall is connected on its northern face.

### Demographics

Like most of Orde, Pallors Fog is made of mostly humans though you are still able to find plenty of elves, halflings, and gnomes around. Tieflings and the feathered races are rarer but not absent.

### Government

Being so close to the wall gives the White Council almost direct control of the town though a locally elected mayor is selected in order to handle the town's day to day governing.

### Defences

With both the nearby Watch Wall and fog to protect them the town itself does not have a major military presence of its own. It does however have a local policing force to deal with troublemakers but in times of need they call upon the wall for help.

### Industry & Trade

Pallors Fog’s economy has grown and changed over time with its biggest influence being the building of the Watch Wall. The city's few farms grow food for the many men that man the wall, and its many taverns are a good place for any weary wall watcher to spend their time relaxing. The city has a prominent blacksmithing guild—which is almost completely dedicated to making and repairing equipment for the wall. Pallors Fog also has a small tourist scene as many are fascinated by the Fog, and many have come to study it over the years.

### Assets

Magic is a major part of Pallors Fog given their intimacy with the mists. Divine magic is particularly encouraged and any discoveries pertaining to the mists themselves are especially valued. While some in the city wish for the mists to be dispelled—as to allow easier travel—most of the town's citizens see it as a sort of holy protector that should only be studied and never altered in any way.

### Guilds and Factions

The White Pantheon has the biggest presence in Pallors Fog with at least one minor church dedicated to each of its gods. The Green Pantheon also has a significant amount of followers within the town though they are not as common, Inca in particular is loved for many think it is the spirit tree which brought about the mists.

### History

Pallors Fog is an old town, older than the Watch Wall. It was settled upon the plateau in hopes of the position being defensible enough to deal with any threats from the badlands. The town was able to hold and grow for a time but eventually it became too big a target and the threats only got bigger. Eventually after failing to defend against several raids from the badlands it is said that a powerful cleric of an unknown god prayed for several days straight for the power to defend the town. The god supposedly granted the wish in the form of the mists. Back then the mists were said to be almost constant, only dispersing for a couple hours when the sun was at its peak. Any, including the towns folk it was meant to protect, who entered the mists would end up lost—never able to find the town until the mists dispersed. The cleric’s name was Pallor and even though it made day to day life harder for the people of the town, the mists did very well at protecting the town and so to honor him they named the town after him. The mist's powers have weakened over time, whether this is due to the magic fading or it being made obsolete by the building of the Watch Wall no one knows for sure. Now the mists are only out during the early hours of sunrise. The people of Pallors Fog have grown accustomed to starting their days later than most to avoid the mists, the town only really waking up once it is clear out. Despite all the years of study, none know the mist's true nature.

### Geography

Pallors Fog is built atop a plateau overlooking the Watch Wall. The whole town is surrounded by a forest enchanted with magic mist. The mist will form just before sunrise and slowly dissipate after several hours. Any who try to travel during this time will invariably end up lost in the woods until the mists subside. This combined with the town being up on a plateau makes it an excellent defensive position in times of conflict.
