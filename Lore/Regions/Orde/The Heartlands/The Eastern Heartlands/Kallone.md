Kallone
=======

A city of wine and food, Kallone is a place of relaxation and reflection.

### Demographics

Kallone contains a diverse population of races, mainly those that are more chaotic, as Kallone is less focused on law and morals than most other settlements. However, races associated with evil such as goblins, kobolds, lizardfolk, etc. are discriminated against because of their savage and hostile stereotypes.

### Government

Autocracy / The noble family who founded this city, the Vandrans, who rule with laws only pertaining to safety and fairness and try to rule as separate from the White Council as legally possible. Currently the Vandrans are headed by Theodore Vandran, eldest son of the founding Vandran generation.

### Defences

Kallone's military consists of paid guards who patrol the settlement and its surrounding farmland on horseback as well as a volunteer citizen militia who take arms whenever the need arises

### Industry & Trade

The economy in Kallone is self-sustaining, with the settlement rarely bringing any goods in from the outside. Despite this, there are a large amount of exports, including a lot of high quality luxury wines. There is also a lot of focus on tourism when it comes close to the Masquerade of Indulging, with many trying to grab overpriced sales off of the visitors.

### Assets

Kallone has functioning aqueducts, paved roads both inside the settlement and outside for a few miles; they also have a small cobblestone wall which is the height of a fence which surrounds the settlement. There is also extra schooling for children which is partially funded by the government.

### Guilds and Factions

There is relatively less religious activity in Kallone compared to the rest of Orde, though there is still a notable amount, especially of worship in the White Pantheon. Since there is a large population of farmers, there is some worship towards the Green Pantheon as well. Churches for both pantheons can be found in the settlement.

### History

Kallone was founded by the noble family of the Vandrans, who moved away from Crestfall to found their own settlement after becoming annoyed with the heavy morals of the settlement and land. The Vandrans gathered people in the town who felt the same; which consisted of a lot of drunks, party-goers, ladies of the night, and other such people. Once together, they traveled for a long while, living nomadically while moving southward towards Krazax. When the mountain range was in sight, the Vandrans decided to hold a party to celebrate their travels. Not just a simple party, however. The Vandrans missed the masquerade parties they had enjoyed so much, so they decided to work with a craftsman named Kallone to create masks for all of the family's there. Kallone made many masks before the festival, and due to a lack of materials, each family's mask was stuck to a single color and simple style. That didn't stop people from wearing them and having fun, for the day of the party was a success, and it became known as the Masquerade of Indulging. During the masquerade, many past farmers came to the Vandrans and remarked on how the fertile soil and calm climate would be great for growing all sorts of crops, and the morning after the party—using the laziness of those who were hungover—the Vandrans announced that they were staying in the land near the border—which would be named after Kallone, the master craftsmen. Most of those who followed the Vandrans—especially the farmers—agreed with this decision; as such farmland of all sorts, most specifically vineyards, started to develop around the settlement. Many luxury wines have come from Kallone, and it is that and the Masquerade of Indulging that attracted many more to the settlement. In order to continue distinguishing families during the masquerade, Kallone and his family continued to craft masks, creating masks to distinguish the age of families. During the masquerade, older families can be seen with simple—single-colored masks—while newer families wear masks with multiple colors and different styles. The masquerade is celebrated once per year, and is followed by a day off for all in the settlement to recover.

### Geography

Kallone is surrounded by green farmlands, with a small patch of woods to the west which has come to be known as Vandran's thicket.
