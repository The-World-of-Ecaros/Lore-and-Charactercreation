Orde
====

Within [The Northern Heartlands](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/the-northern-heartlands-location) lies the country of Orde. A supposed utopia of wealth and plenty. The citizens of which live under the constant supervision of [The White Pantheon](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/white-pantheon-article) and its organized religions.

### Structure

Theocratic Meritocracy

### History

Orde was a country formed slowly from those that fled the fall of the Elven Empire. They quickly formed a country based on religious freedom, that believed that the cruelties and dark magics the Elven Empire used were the cause of their misfortune and misery. As time went on an ironic view of religious freedom was eventually replaced with the standard moral goods; this invoked a sense of order and good will, in exchange for a sharp prejudice. Every 20 years or so the White Council replaces its various parts, allowing new ideas to spread and change to become possible. However, Orde's mistrust of the darker things have led to many unfortunate events from war, to the rise of the Inquisition. The Reckoning shattered the belief system of Orde to its very core. Not only did they have to use the power of evil to assist in defending the Seven against a great threat, but they lost many of their deities of the past in this time of trouble. Modern day Orde attempts to follow the Seven's doctrine of hope, but old habits die hard and there is a stirring of mistrust and a quiet desperation for this peace can only be maintained for so long and the scales are imbalanced. The White Council has summoned the Inquisition as a safeguard against evil's inevitable return.

### Demography and Population

The population of Orde is quite diverse, featuring races from all corners of Aekrath. Humans do come out slightly ahead in numbers, with tieflings coming in at the lowest. The ieflings Orde, although the country itself holds no official prejudice against them, do not feel comfortable in the country. Other races that share difficult to understand powers or forms usually stay within the outlier settlements.

### Military

Orde's military force is mostly composed of the Order of the White Council, a contingent of paladins from The White Pantheon. There are also a few militia contracts with mercenaries in the outlier towns, which is comprised of religiously inclined warriors. The Justicars keep order as the main policing force for the cities.

### Religion

The White Pantheon is unquestionably the most represented in Orde, most of the deities within it, have their main churches within the country. Other religions, save for those that serve evil are welcome within Orde.

### Infrastructure

Orde is perhaps the most well developed in terms of infrastructure out of all the countries. Instead of only a few cities with paved roads, nearly all of the cities in Orde benefit from paved roads and fully operational aqueducts.
