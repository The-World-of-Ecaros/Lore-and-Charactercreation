Arcane Recovery
---------------

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.  For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots.  You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. 

Spellcasting
------------

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. 

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. 

#### Spellbook

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind. 

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.  You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your wizard spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared. 

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. 

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook. 

#### Spellbooks

The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.  A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.  **Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.  
Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.  For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.  A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When you copy a spell from a spell scroll, you must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.  **Replacing the Book.** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.  
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.  **The Book's Appearance.** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap. 

Arcane Tradition
----------------

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition from the list of available traditions, shaping your practice of magic. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.  _**Note:** The subclasses listed here are created for use in the Living World of Ecaros. Information on the official subclasses can be found in their respective books._  [Cruormancer](#spoiler-wo89n5)

### Cruormancer

_"Magic in the blood," a concept sorcerers only believe they understand. But true might comes from the blood itself - you understand this and have learned the secrets of the sanguine._ 

#### Spellbook Augmentation

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved. 

#### Bloodprice

Starting at 2nd level, whenever you cast a spell that would cause an enemy to make a saving throw, you can consume your own hit points to increase the spell's potency. You spend a number of hit points equal to your character level to increase the saving throw DC of the spell by 1. You can do this up to three times per spell. After you use this feature, you cannot regain hit points for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, as your body is in shock.  

[Cyphermage](#spoiler-NEq34A)

### Cyphermage

_Magic has many forms and you have focused yourself on the mastery of the glyph, the rune, and the ward. Instead of casting spells in the traditional manner, you convert them into one of these three forms for use in rapid succession._ 

#### Spellbook Augmentation

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you infuse your magic into your spellbook to quickly write your runes, glyphs, and wards. You must always have your spellbook in one of your hands. If you do not, you cannot cast spells nor can you benefit from set spells. However, while you are wielding your spellbook, it provides you a +2 bonus to AC that does not stack with a shield. 

#### Inscribe

You can no longer cast spells of 1st level or higher normally, instead, you can “set” these spells in one of three forms; Glyph, Ward, or Rune. The following are the rules for setting spells:

* **Glyph:** A glyph is set on an object or surface. You must choose a surface that can support the application of magic in order to set a spell in this way.
    * **Glyph Triggers:** Pressure, Proximity or Timed.
* **Ward:** A Ward is set on a creature or object. You must choose a willing creature or object that can support the application of magic in order to set magic in this way.
    * **Ward Triggers:** Attacked, Proximity or Timed.
* **Rune:** A rune is set on a hostile creature or on a surface. It must be an applicable surface or the creature needs to fail its saving throw to be set in this way.
    * **Rune Triggers:** Timed, Action or Activation.

Glyphs, wards, and runes are visual representations of written magic wherever they're placed. They're always visible, unless visually blocked by heavy obscuration or cover. A set glyph or rune on a surface always takes up the space of a 5-foot square on that surface, while a set glyph, ward, or rune on an object or creature conforms to the size of that object or creature. A visible glyph, ward, or rune can be identified with an Intelligence (Arcana) check at DC 12 + the spell's level.  There can be no more than 3 glyphs, wards, or runes set on an object or creature in a single 5-foot square, regardless of the object or creature's individual sizes. There can only be 1 set glyph or rune on a 5-foot surface.  Set spells last until triggered, or until you prepare spells or otherwise finish a long rest, whichever happens first. Set spells that disappear due to you preparing spells or finishing a long rest do so harmlessly.  The following are the rules for triggers and their general application:

* **Pressure:** This triggers if it is stepped on or attacked directly. The DM may also rule other extreme forces from a falling object or pushed creature can also trigger the set magic.
* **Proximity:** This triggers based on any creature entering proximity. You determine the proximity in increments of feet, up to the spell's range. If the spell has a range of self, the proximity range can be up to 5 feet. You can choose to have the set spell ignore you when you initially set it, and during your turn at a later time to then count you for its proximity.
* **Timed:** This triggers based on a set timer, determined by you. The timing must be set in increments of rounds, minutes, or hours. In combat, the increments are based off your turn in the initiative. You cannot set a spell to go off at a precise time, such as noon.
* **Attacked:** This triggers based on whether or not an enemy takes a hostile action against the warded creature. This trigger has additional definitions that must be clarified: it can trigger from an attack roll or a saving throw, but not both. The selection is made when you set the spell.
* **Action:** This triggers based on whether an enemy does or does not take a predetermined maneuver. The maneuvers that can be chosen in this manner are attack, cast spell, move, or item interaction.
* **Activation:** This triggers based on whether another glyph, rune, or ward is triggered. The corresponding set spells must be within 30 feet of each other in order for this trigger to function.

When you set a spell, you or your familiar must be able to touch the surface, object or creature. Setting a spell requires the same spell components and takes the same casting time as normally casting it would. For spells that require a reaction to an event, you instead use your reaction during your turn to set it. A spell set in this manner uses the applied placement as its point of origin for the spell, and is triggered as long as you can see both the set spell and the trigger. You choose targets, direct area-of-effects, or other such interactions as normal once a set spell is triggered. If the spell has a range of touch, or requires an attack to be made, the range is determined from the set spell's placement, not you. For example, a glyph of Mage Armor, when triggered by proximity, can only be used to affect a creature that is within touch range of the glyph, provided you are able to see the target when it's triggered.  When a rune is set on an unwilling creature, they must make a saving throw if the spell would normally have one. If the spell would not normally have one for a creature, then they must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature fails this save, the rune is placed on them and, should it be triggered, they suffer the spell's effects. They do not receive an additional saving throw when the spell is triggered.  When you set a spell that requires concentration, you do not concentrate on it until it is triggered.  Set spells are considered hard cast and interact with effects that require casting a spell when a set spell is triggered, not when they're set.  

[Void Mage](#spoiler-kLGoBd)

### Void Mage

_There is a structure of magic that lies on the other side, a sort of aetheric nothingness, that moves into shape and form. Although it is difficult to manipulate, some mages focus on this intriguing and mysterious force._ 

#### Spellbook Augmentation

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that deals force damage into your spell book is halved. 

#### Forceful Magic

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you gain Eldritch Blast as a cantrip, and it counts as a wizard cantrip for you. Whenever you cast a spell that deals force damage, that spell deals an additional point of damage for each target equal to the level of the spell.  

Ability Score Improvement
-------------------------

When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  Alternatively, you may take a feat.

### Cruormancer

#### Backlash

At 6th level, whenever you receive damage from a critical hit, you can use your reaction to hard cast a spell of your choice that has a casting time of an action or bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.  

[Cyphermage](#spoiler-5yn3lG)

### Cyphermage

#### Rising Tempo

At 6th level, whenever you cast a damaging cantrip, its damage is increased by 1 for each glyph, ward or rune within 15 feet of you, to a maximum of 5. The damage increase applies to each application of damage from the cantrip.  

[Void Mage](#spoiler-zuJV3i)

### Void Mage

#### Grasp of the Void

At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to choose an enemy you can see within 30 feet and pull on its existence from the void. This causes them to have disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks for 1d4 rounds. While the enemy is affected by this feature, you also have disadvantage on such rolls. If the enemy is defeated while under this effect, you gain advantage to these rolls equal to the number of rounds you suffered the disadvantage in this way (minimum of 1 round). Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.  

Ability Score Improvement
-------------------------

When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  Alternatively, you may take a feat.

### Cruormancer

#### The Master Calls

At 10th level, whenever an enemy takes damage from a spell you hard cast, they also receive an amount of bleeding damage equal to the spell's level. This only applies once per source.  

[Cyphermage](#spoiler-zDg78z)

### Cyphermage

#### Cypherwalking

At 10th level, you can use a bonus action to teleport to any rune, glyph, or ward you can see. If it is on a surface, you teleport to the 5-foot square, or if it is on a creature or object, you teleport within 5 feet of it.  

[Void Mage](#spoiler-WMrQsR)

### Void Mage

#### Darkwalker

At 10th level, you gain resistance to cold and necrotic damage. In addition, the first time you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you are reduced to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.  

Ability Score Improvement
-------------------------

When you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  Alternatively, you may take a feat. 

Arcane Tradition feature
------------------------

At 14th level, you gain a feature granted by your Arcane Tradition.  [Cruormancer](#spoiler-oXWtxb)

### Cruormancer

#### Fear the Old Blood

At 14th level, you can use your Bloodprice feature any number of times per spell.  

[Cyphermage](#spoiler-Xkvja7)

### Cyphermage

#### Cyphertechnics

At 14th level, you can use a bonus action to choose up to three runes, wards, or glyphs that you can see within 30 feet. You cause them to explode, dealing 1d8 force damage per spell level of the set spell within 15 feet of each of their placements to enemies. This effect can be used to trigger any other glyph, rune or ward of your choice, but they must be within 30 feet of each other.  

[Void Mage](#spoiler-LarCLL)

### Void Mage

#### Forzare’

At 14th level, if you defeat an enemy with a spell that deals force damage, that enemy screams as void energy flows out from it. A Magic Missile spell of the highest level you can cast is cast from the enemy's space, striking out at random enemy targets within range. This feature can trigger itself, but only a maximum number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier in one instance.  

Ability Score Improvement
-------------------------

When you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  Alternatively, you may take a feat. 

Spell Mastery
-------------

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.  By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels. 

Ability Score Improvement
-------------------------

When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.  Alternatively, you may take a feat. 

Signature Spells
----------------

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.  If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.
