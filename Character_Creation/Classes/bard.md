Bardic Inspiration
------------------

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.  Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.  Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. 

Spellcasting
------------

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list. 

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, learning a 3rd cantrip at 4th level and a 4th at 10th level. 

#### Spell Slots

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot. 

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.  You learn an additional bard spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 16th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.  Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. 

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. 

Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus. 

Song of Rest (d6)
-----------------

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points by spending Hit Dice at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.  The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level. 

Bard College
------------

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice from the list of available colleges.

Information on the official subclasses can be found in their respective books._  [Jester](#spoiler-g5plMr)

#### Scarring Mockery

Beginning at 3rd level, the Jester knows the true power of one's sense of self-worth. As such their mockery is deep cutting and destructive. The Vicious Mockery cantrip is empowered for you. The base damage die of the Vicious Mockery cantrip is now 1d8 and all scaling uses this die as well. This mockery can be empowered further by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration to roll the die and add the number rolled as extra damage to the cantrip. 

#### Gallows Humor

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you take damage from an attack roll, you can choose to mock yourself, adding 1d8 psychic damage to the damage roll.

Roll the dice and add them together. If you have no Bardic Inspiration uses remaining, you can roll a number of d8's equal to your Charisma modifier instead.
