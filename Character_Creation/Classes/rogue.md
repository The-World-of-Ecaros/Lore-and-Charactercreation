Expertise
---------

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.  At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit. 

Sneak Attack
------------

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.  You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.  The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. 

Thieves' Cant
-------------

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.  In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. 

Cunning Action
--------------

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. 

Roguish Archetype
-----------------

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities from the list of available archetypes. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.  _**Note:** The subclasses listed here are created for use in the Living World of Ecaros. Information on the official subclasses can be found in their respective books._  [Pirate](#spoiler-psZgCo)

### Pirate

_The seas are a dangerous place for a minnow like you, kid. Iâ€™m a shark, so if you don't want to get eaten, you better have some gold to give me._ 

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the navigators tools and cartographers tools. If you become a member of the Freemen, you gain a +2 on these rolls for as long as you are in the faction. 

#### Plunder and Thunder

When you choose this archetype 3rd level, you gain an additional 10% wealth when you find a treasure hoard. This stacks with other hoard modifiers.  In addition, as a bonus action, you can mark an enemy for death. For 1 minute, you deal sneak attack damage to that creature regardless of circumstances. However, the creature has advantage on attack rolls against you. If this creature is defeated within the minute of this ability, Kaheeli rewards your audacity - you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls for the remainder of the combat encounter. You can use this ability multiple times in the same combat encounter. However, each time the bonus stacks while benefiting from this bonus, each creature you mark has this bonus to attack you as well. Once the combat encounter in which this ability is used ends, you must finish long rest before you can use it again.

Ability Score Improvement

Evasion
-------

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell.

#### Blasted and Blasting

Starting at 13th level, whenever you would receive a critical hit from an enemy, you can use a reaction to attack them back with a melee weapon. If the enemy's attack is a ranged attack, you can switch to a ranged weapon, dropping what you had in your hands to equip it, and make an attack against them. This attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 16-20.  You are immune to negative effects of being drunk.

Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
