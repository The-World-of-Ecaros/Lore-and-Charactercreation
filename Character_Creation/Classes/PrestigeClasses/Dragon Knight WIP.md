### Abilities

#### Level 4:

**Draconic Resilience:** You gain Damage Reduction equal to your proficiency for the element associated with your Dragon’s damage type.  

**Draconic Blessing:** Your martial attacks and your spell damage both gain an additional 1d4 of damage of your associated dragon damage type. For spells to gain this, they must originally deal the same damage as your dragon damage type. This damage increases to 2d4 at level 8 for your martial attacks and spell damage, and then to 3d4 at level 12. This effect can only occur once per round.  

**Draconic Armaments:** You gain proficiency in heavy armor. 

#### Level 8:

**Hardened Scales:** While wearing heavy armor, you gain 3 Damage Reduction to non magical physical damage. This applies to your dragon’s damage type as well. For example, at level 8 you would have 6 DR against your dragon’s damage type, and 3 DR against non magical bludgeoning piercing and slashing.  

**Dragon's Reckoning:** When you take damage that is the same as your Dragon Damage Type, you may deal additional damage equal to half of the damage received when you next deal damage of your Dragon Damage Type., This bonus damage bypasses resistance. You can use this a number of times equal to your class level in Dragon Knight, to a maximum of 3. This effect can be used 3 times and recharges on a short or long rest. 

#### Level 12:

**Dragon's Heart:** When you deal your dragon damage type, you can choose to gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt as a bonus action. This applies to one source of damage on a single target. You can use this once per Long Rest.  

**Dragon's Domain:** As a bonus action, your melee attacks gain the reach property. If they already have this property, they gain an additional 5 feet of range and the Cleaving property, as explained in the Improved Armory rules in World Anvil. Additionally, all AoE Spells cast this turn have an increased radius of 5 ft and their damage increased by 2d6 of your dragon's damage type. This lasts for 1 round and can be used up to 3 times per long rest.

### Prestige Abilities

#### Prestige 1:

 **Phantasmal wings:** As an action, you sprout magical wings, the color reflecting your dragon’s element. You gain a fly speed of 10 feet per prestige you have, or if you already have a fly speed, your fly speed is increased by 10 feet per prestige you have. This effect lasts for 1 minute. 

#### Prestige 2:

**Ethereal Tail:** You can make a tail attack as a bonus action using an ethereal tail. You are considered proficient with this attack, and it uses strength. This attack deals 1d12+Prestige damage of your dragon’s element, has a 15 ft range, and benefits from your Draconic Blessing. This can be used once per short rest. 

#### Prestige 3:

**Dragon’s Bite:** When you make an attack of opportunity, you manifest the Maw of an ancient dragon. This attack deals 4d4 + your prestige level of your Dragon Damage Type and benefits from the spell aspect of your Draconic Blessing. You are considered proficient with this attack, and it uses strength. This can be used once per short rest. 

#### Prestige 4:

**Draconic Ferocity:** After scoring a critical hit, all enemies within 30 ft must make a Wisdom Save equal to 8+proficiency+your prestige level. Enemies feared in this way become vulnerable, receive double damage, to your Dragon Damage Type until the end of your next turn. If they have resistance to your Dragon Damage Type, they are no longer resistant. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. This can be triggered once per combat.
