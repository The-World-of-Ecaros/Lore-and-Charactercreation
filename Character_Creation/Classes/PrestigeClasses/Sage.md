Bleeding caused by The Master Calls is now incredibly difficult to remove as long as you are within 90 feet of the bleeding creature(s). In addition to the normal methods required to remove bleeding, any creature attempting to remove the bleed must also make a medicine check (they can use arcana instead if magical healing is the method used). If the result of the check is higher than your spell save DC they are able to clear the bleed normally, however for every point below the creature suffers an additional stack of bleed.  

[Cypher](#spoiler-aZ3VeM)

**Everywhere and Nowhere.** Whenever a hostile creature triggers a rune, glyph or ward you set, you can make an arcana check (DC = CR of triggering creature) with a success telling you the creatures type and subtype, as well as whether it’s travelling alone or with a group. Additionally, you can use the Cypherwalking class feature as a reaction to avoid being hit with a melee attack.

[Void](#spoiler-N5VA8U)

**Grasping Void** Once per turn when you would deal force damage to a creature, it’s movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of your next turn. This effect stacks up to three times, and the duration is refreshed every time a new stack would be applied. As a bonus action, you can consume three stacks to force the creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be restrained for 1 minute as a large shadowy hand grips the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and has advantage if it is a Large creature or bigger.  

[Bladesinger](#spoiler-jCbKIQ)
