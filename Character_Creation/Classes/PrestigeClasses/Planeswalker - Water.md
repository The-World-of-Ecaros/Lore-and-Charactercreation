The affected targets must make a constitution saving throw, or lose their reaction until the start of your next turn.

### Tier 2: Level 8

 You gain the following abilities:  **Planar attunement:** You gain resistance to cold damage. If you already have resistance to cold damage, instead gain DR to cold damage equal to your proficiency.  **Drowning Bell:** When you make an attack or hard cast a spell that deals cold damage, you may use your bonus action to force a number of targets up to your proficiency modifier to make a constitution saving throw. These targets must have been damaged by the attack or spell in question. When a target fails, they are considered silenced until the end of their next turn. You may use this once per Long rest.  **Ocean's Fury:** As an action, you call upon the fury of the elemental plane of water. For the next minute, all your attacks and spells deal an additional 2 points of cold damage. The additional damage from this can only benefit one damage roll per target.

As an action, you can select a number of foes up to your proficiency bonus + your spell casting modifier within 90 ft. and force them to make a constitution saving throw. If they have been hit by cold damage in the last round, the save is made at disadvantage. On failure, they are stunned until the start of your next turn. You are also stunned for the same duration. You can use this once per long rest. If the stun on you is removed, it is also removed on the affected enemies.  **Aqua Dominus:** While you are affected by water breathing, you suffer no disadvantages to attacking or casting spells while in or under water.

Creatures restrained in this way take an additional 3 cold whenever they are damaged by another source. This damage occurs once per turn.
