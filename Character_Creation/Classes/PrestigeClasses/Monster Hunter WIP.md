Monster Hunter WIP
==================

Created by Crystal and Ravion

### Requirements

 You must be any class of 4th level or higher.  You must have a Stetonian Origin or be a member of the Steton Striders (Loyalty 1).  This prestige class replaces the following ASIs 4th / 8th / 12th. 

Lore
----

_Hunting monsters and gathering their materials is deeply rooted in Stetonian culture. As such, Stetonians are the best monster hunters Ecaros have ever seen. Rivaled only by Daborak's discipline, Stetonian fury on the battlefield is a sight to be feared, especially by the creatures unfortunate enough to draw their ire, as their unique styles can bring down even the mightiest of behemoths._ 

Mechanics

### Hunting Art

You gain one of the following fighting styles:  
  

**\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-**

#### Feather Style

_These hunters are light on their feet and see the monsters they face as only a stepping stone to spring themselves skyward._  When you jump and attack a creature within 10 feet that is at least one size larger than you (minimum large creature size), you can use your reaction to vault onto the creature and mount its back with a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the creature’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics). While on a creature’s back, you can not be targeted by the creature, being within 5 feet of the creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls, and if you score a critical hit with an attack, the creature is knocked prone and stunned until the end of your next turn. After scoring a critical hit in this way, you automatically dismount in an unoccupied space of your choice within 5 feet of the creature.  At the start of the creature's turn, it can make a Strength (Athletics) check to forcibly dismount you. On a success, you are dismounted in an unoccupied space of the creature's choice within 5 feet of it. The creature can reattempt this check by using an action to roll, bump into terrain, or any other reasonable method to forcibly dismount you.  _Prestige 1_  
You gain a +2 bonus to this dismount check.  _Prestige 2_  
You gain a +4 bonus to this dismount check.  _Prestige 3_  
You gain a +6 bonus to this dismount check.  _Prestige 4_  
You gain a +8 bonus to this dismount check.

#### Glory Style

_These hunters smile at the sight of an attacking behemoth and welcome the clash of wills that legends are made of._  When in combat with a creature that is at least one size larger than you (minimum large creature size), if you don't move on your turn, you can choose to enter a challenging stance until the start of your next turn. When in this stance, the first source of damage you would take from a creature that is larger than you is reduced by half and you can make an attack against this creature as a reaction to being damaged by it if it is within range of your weapon.  _Prestige 1_  
You gain a +1 bonus to this attack and damage roll.  _Prestige 2_  
You gain a +2 bonus to this attack and damage roll.  _Prestige 3_  
You gain a +3 bonus to this attack and damage roll.  _Prestige 4_  
You gain a +4 bonus to this attack and damage roll.

#### Weaver Style

_These hunters are adept at timing the right moment to weave through a monster’s overwhelming onslaught._  When a creature that is at least one size larger than you makes an attack against you (minimum large creature size), you can use your reaction to make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + the creature’s attack bonus. On a success you avoid the attack and can move up to 15 feet away from the creature without provoking an opportunity attack. On a failure, you take the attack as normal and the creature gains advantage on their next attack roll against you.  _Prestige 1_  
You gain a +1 bonus to this save.  _Prestige 2_  
You gain a +2 bonus to this save.  _Prestige 3_  
You gain a +3 bonus to this save.  _Prestige 4_  
You gain a +4 bonus to this save.

At 12th level you receive the following: 

### The Bigger They Are...

You are considered one size larger for the purposes of grappling, shoving, carry weight, and wielding weapons.  For each size category a creature has over you (you are considered to be medium size for this ability if you are small or tiny), you deal an additional 1d6 damage against that creature with weapon attacks.  In addition, if you score a score a critical hit against a creature that is at least one size larger than you (minimum large creature size), they must make a Constitution saving throw equal to: 

> 10 + Proficiency + Your Weapon’s Attack Bonus + Prestige

 On a failure, the creature is knocked prone and stunned until the end of your next turn. Should the creature already be stunned from a different and/or simultaneous source, they are stunned for an additional round.
