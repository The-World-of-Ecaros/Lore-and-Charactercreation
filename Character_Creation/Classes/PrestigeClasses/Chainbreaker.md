Much has been spoken of Cassius’s divine deeds and legend regarding the freedoms he earned humanity and the enemies he defeated along the way. Little however is spoken of how he went about his divine quest. Chainbreakers are commonly thought to be the inheritors of his freedom fighting ways and fighting style, and fight in the same ways Cassius did all those years ago.  Chainbreakers often denoted by their use of chains as weapons, using the tools of their oppression against their oppressors. These chains often reflect the user’s accomplishments and strength in the face of the adversity the world has thrown at them. As such the chains employed by any given chainbreaker are often different from one another.  _Prerequisite: Cassius lip service_ 

### Level 4

#### Chain Weapon Proficiency

Upon becoming a Chainbreaker, you gain a proficiency in the following chain weapons:  **Quick Chain**

* Damage: 1d6 Bludgeoning
* Weight: 2 lbs
* Properties: Reach(10ft.), Finesse, Light
* Weapon group: Flails

 **Brutish Chain**

* Damage: 1d8 Bludgeoning
* Weight: 6 lbs
* Properties: Reach(10ft.), Versatile (1d10), Catching
* Special: You gain a +1 bonus on contested Strength (Athletics) ability checks to maintain grapples made with this weapon
* Weapon group: Flails

 You may turn an appropriate length of chain into either chain weapon after spending an hour to modify the chains to the preferred type. Chain Weapons may be used in conjunction with class abilities such as but not limited to, Pact of the Blade. Magical chains used as the material for a chain weapon, they lose their magical properties as an item but the resulting chain weapon count as a magical weapon for bypassing resistances. Chain weapons may be also crafted by a Chainbreaker via the crafting system. 

#### Anchor Chain

As an action, you can attach your chain to any point within reach. While anchored and using movement, you can use it in combat as a tripwire between yourself and the anchor point. Enemies must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + proficiency + strength/dexterity) or become prone. An enemy can only be affected by this once per turn. Enemies with a fly speed are immune to this effect. The chain can be detached again as a free action and you cannot attack with the chain weapon until this is done. 

### Level 8

#### Chain Pull

You can make an attack roll to lash out with your chain and anchor yourself to the target enemy within double of your reach, dealing a d4 for damage. You pull yourself to the nearest empty space by the target immediately, however if the creature is 1 size smaller or more than you then it is pulled to the nearest empty space by you instead. 

#### Break the Chains

At the start of your turn, you can end the grappled or restrained condition on yourself (no action required by you). You can do so a number of times equal to your Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is higher and a minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

### Level 12

#### Chainstorm

As an action you can make attacks with your chain for 2d6 + prestige damage against all hostiles within your reach. You can do this twice, regaining both uses when you finish a long rest. 

#### Ground Rip

Once per turn, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a ground rip. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. You throw your chain to its full reach and impale it into the ground, before pulling the chain upwards to tear the ground asunder and return it to your grasp. A line that is 5 feet wide and as long as your chain originating from you becomes difficult terrain, and all creatures in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or fall prone.  

### Prestige Bonuses

#### Chain Augments

When you gain a point of Prestige, you can choose one of the options for the corresponding tier to augment your chain weapons. The chosen augments are automatically applied to your chain weapons when you wield them. Additional, each tier of Prestige earned increases the reach of your chain weapons by 5 feet.
