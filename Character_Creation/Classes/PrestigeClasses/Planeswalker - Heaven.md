* * *

### Abilities:

#### Tier 1 - Level 4

**Heavenly Body** \- You gain 2 additional die for your hit die pool. Every level after, you gain an additional hit die. This does not affect your max HP.  **Reward** \- When short resting, allies gain half of the amount you roll for healing from hit die as HP, not including your Con modifier or any other bonuses. You may use this twice a long rest. 

#### Tier 2 - Level 8

Protection from the Heavens - When rolling hit dice on a short rest, instead of regaining hit points, you can add half the value rolled as temporary hit points, not including Con modifier, up to a maximum of equal to three times your (level + prestige). These temporary hit points last until your next short rest or for 8 hours, whichever is first. This still uses the hit die. When you have this temporary HP up, you have advantage on concentration saves for spells when attacked.  **Shared Blessings** \- When a healing spell is hard cast, you can use your reaction to roll 2 hit dice to give temp HP equal to half the value rolled to two allies within 10 ft of the target of the spell. This does not affect the original target. When a spell is cast that gives bonuses to max HP, movement speed, bonuses to non-attack rolls, or resistances, you can use your reaction to expend 2 hit dice to give the caster advantage on their next concentration check. You can use this twice in a combat encounter. 

#### Tier 3 - Level 12

**Saving Grace** \- As a reaction, spend 3 hit die. An ally within 30 ft that would be dropped to 0 HP instead is placed into stasis before the attack would land. They do not suffer the damage, cannot be targeted by any ability, effects, or spells while in stasis, and they cannot take any actions. This effect lasts until the beginning of your turn. This can be done once per combat.  **Forged from Radiance** \- As an action, you can choose to spend 4 hit die. If you do, 2 allies within 60 ft gain +2 AC for 2 rounds. This does not stack with other AC buffs. You can use this feature once per combat encounter.

### Prestige Abilities

#### Prestige 1:

**Speedy Intervention** \- As a bonus action, use 2 hit die to cast Bless on up to 3 targets. You can use this ability 2 times per short rest. 

#### Prestige 2:

**Playful Guardian** \- At the beginning of combat, an animal guardian is summoned and sticks to your side. This summon lasts one minute. Once per round, you can teleport it to an ally you can see. While attached to a willing creature, it gives them AC equal to half your Prestige rounded down. At the beginning of your turn, you choose an action for it to use until your next turn. * Until the start of your next turn, the next attack against the creature the guardian is attached to is at disadvantage.
* As a reaction, the guardian can push its attached creature in any direction 15 ft out of danger without suffering any opportunity attacks.
**Prestige bonus:** At tier 3, the Guardian gains life sense up to 10 ft. 

#### Prestige 3:

**Heavenly Respite**\- When an ally within 40 ft of you takes at least 40 damage in one turn, you may expend 4 hit die as a reaction if the ally has not been reduced to 0 HP. The ally is then teleported to a heavenly plane and return at the beginning of their next turn. They gain 10 temp HP, and can move to an unoccupied space within 10 ft of their original position. This can be done a number of times equal to your prestige per long rest. 

#### Prestige 4:

**Radiant Compassion** \- As an action, choose an amount of hit die to use and roll them. In a 15 ft radius within 60 ft range, you heal allies equal to the number rolled. You can do this twice per day.
