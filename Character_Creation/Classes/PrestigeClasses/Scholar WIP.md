You can wait until after you have rolled the d20 before deciding to use this die, but you must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
* Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can roll an additional d20. You can choose to do so after you have rolled the initial die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.
