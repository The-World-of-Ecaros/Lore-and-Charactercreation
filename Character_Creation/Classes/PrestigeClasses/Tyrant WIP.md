### Abilities

#### Level 4

 You gain access to the following abilities  **Overwhelming Might**  
As Astaroth’s might made manifest, none can stand against your Strength. When you succeed on a Strength or Athletics check against an enemy, you deal damage equal to your Strength modifier to them, and gain a stack of Dominion. Dominion is then used for your other abilities. (You start each fight at 0 dominion.)  **Tyrant’s Command**  
As a reaction to enemy movement, you can expend at least one stack of Dominion to cast the spell Command against that enemy. You gain access to the command spell if you do not have it already. Your maximum dominion is equal to your level + your prestige.

#### Level 8

 You gain access to the following abilities  **Fist of Dominion**  
Whenever you deal damage to an enemy, gain a stack of Dominion.  You can expend 2 stacks of Dominion to grant yourself advantage on your next attack. This effect can be used once per turn.  **The Meek shall Obey**  
You can use a stack of Dominion to impose disadvantage on the next save to resist your Command Spell.  **Domination through Might**  
You use Strength as your spell save modifier when casting command.  **Detailed Orders**  
You can expend an additional stack of Dominion when you cast Command, increasing the amount of words you can use, up to 2.

#### Level 12

 You gain access to the following abilities  **Dominus Rex**  
You gain 1 Dominion at the start of your turn.  **Know your Place**  
When a creature succeeds against one of your commands, your next attack against it deals an additional d8 damage. You can command enemies to attack their allies. (without using any special abilities like non-cantrip spells or limited day abilities.)  **Tyranny Unbridled**  
Your Fist of Dominion ability can be used once per attack, as long as you have the Dominion necessary to use it.

You can order enemies to hurt themselves (without using any special abilities like non-cantrip spells or limited day abilities).  

#### Prestige 3

Commands last/are repeated every turn until the save is successful. You cannot cast another command or the previous command is removed. 

#### Prestige 4

 **By Astaroth's Will**  
Your commands can affect 1 additional person per 4 dominion you spend.  **By my Command!**

| _Restrain_ | The target will attempt to grapple the nearest creature allied to them. |
