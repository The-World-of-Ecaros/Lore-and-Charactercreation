Prestige Classes
================

Prestige classes represent augmentations to your current class, that allows for additional abilities, specialized ability replacements, or empowered effects. These benefits can be empowered through the further gain of prestige, but keep in mind that prestige classes have many costs associated with them, such as prestige prerequisites and as well as an expenditure of an ASI.  A prestige class may have an amount of prestige required to take it, in addition to other requirements, but it will always have a level the character is required to meet or exceed in a single class.  **Basic Requirement:** Class level (Ex: Level 4 and above, Level 8 and above, Level 12 and above, etc.)  **Special Requirement(s):** Prestige, story based, selection based, academy based, etc.  **Multiclassing:** You cannot have class levels in more than one base class when you take a prestige class. If you have taken a prestige class, you cannot take another prestige class and you are prevented from taking levels in any other class than your current one.  **Save DC's for Prestige Classes** Saving throw DC for Prestige Classes is equal to 8 + Proficiency + Ability Modifier + Prestige

#### Retroactive ASI replacement and Prestige Classes

Should you take a prestige class that fills an ASI slot you already have filled, the Prestige Class replaces it and the old ASI or feat is lost.  Once a prestige class is taken, it is locked in and any ASI slots or Class Levels associated with it can not be retrained through academies.  If taken at a level above 4,the ASI will be lost retroactively.

#### Leaving a Prestige Class

It is possible to leave a prestige class by feat retraining through academies at increased cost given the number of ASI's you have obtained for the prestige class  Upon leaving a prestige class you cannot choose to become the same one again
