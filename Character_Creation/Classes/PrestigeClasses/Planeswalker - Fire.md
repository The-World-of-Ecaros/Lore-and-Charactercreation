### Tier 1: Level 4

 You gain the following abilities:  **Flame Walker:** As a bonus action, you can choose to take irresistible fire damage equal to your class level to alter your spells to deal fire damage instead of other types of damage if they do not already deal fire damage. This change applies to instantaneous spells or the initial cast and can only be active during true combat.   **Fiery Escape:** As an action, you can dash 15 ft, leaving a wall of fire in your wake. The flames reach 20 ft high and have a 5 ft width. Any who attempt to cross the flames must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 1d8 fire damage and are unable to cross. If they succeed, they only take half the damage and make it through the flames. You may do this once per short rest/long rest.  **Prestige effect:** The damage increases by 1d8 for each level of prestige you have.  

### Tier 2: Level 8

 You gain the following abilities:  **Accelerant:** Fire damage caused by you or a source created by you deal an additional 2 points of damage. This damage can only be added to the spellâ€™s damage once per round on the target of your choice.  **Prestige effect:** The damage is increased by one for each level of prestige you have.  **Hateful Retribution:** For the first time you are hit on each round, the source of the damage makes a Dexterity Saving roll equal to your Planeswalker Fire DC. On failure, they are dealt 1d10 fire damage.  

### Tier 3: Level 12

 You gain the following abilities:  **No Happy Endings:** As an action, you can enter a rage. While in this rage, you emit a blaze in a 10 ft sphere centered on you. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save the creature takes 2d8 + your spellcasting modifier fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, Whenever you deal spell damage, half of the dice rolled, (to a minimum of one) roll max damage. Once activated, this ability lasts 4 rounds. If you are knocked unconscious before the rage ends, all creatures within 10 ft of you must make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save a target takes 4d8 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
 **Prestige effect:** You may do this an extra time for each 2 prestige you have per long rest.  **They Will Know You Were Here:** For fire spells, a 5 ft cube of flame is left behind at the target area or the center of the effect. When a creature crosses flames left this way, they must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they take 2d6 fire damage. This can be dispelled or extinguished normally. Spells that normally leave an area of fire are not altered by this ability. Flames last 4 rounds.  

### Tier 4: Level 16

 You gain the following abilities:  **Hatred Spreads:** At the beginning of your turn, roll a d20. If you roll a 15 or above, flames that have been created or left behind by you flare and deal 4d6 damage to every creature within 10 ft of them.  **Infected by Rage:** Flames shimmer in your eyes, and wisps of smoke rise from you(Yes you smell like a bonfire). You are immune to fire damage. Additionally, you cannot be affected by spells that would affect your mind, such as Calm Emotion and Charm.  

### Prestige bonuses

##### Prestige 1:

**Firecracker**  
As a reaction, when you deal fire damage, you may choose to have the target, or those within 5 feet of the initial cast point, to roll a Con save equal to your Planeswalker Fire DC. On Failure, they are blinded until the end of their next turn. This can be done a number of times equal to your prestige per long rest. 

##### Prestige 2:

**Mark Them**  
As a bonus action, you can make your spell or attack inflict a burn. It will deal half damage and ignite the target for 1d6 rounds. At the beginning of each of the targets turn, they will suffer 1d10 fire damage for the duration. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends. 

##### Prestige 3

**Breaking Point**  
Your rage cannot be contained, as you let loose a roar of anguish. All enemies within 20 ft of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save a target is set ablaze and take Accelerant damage, in addition they are driven to an unrelenting rage by Lorita where they can no longer distinguish friend and foe, all damage they deal is fire damage and the nearest creature becomes their primary focus. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the ability ends on the target. You may use this effect once per day. 

##### Prestige 4

**Shared Cataclysm**  
As a reaction to a target being damaged by a fire spell, they take half of the total damage again, while all creatures within 10ft of the target make a Dex saving throw equal to your Planeswalker Fire DC. On Failure, they also take half of the original spell damage. On success, they take a quarter of the original spell damage. This ability can be used 3 times per long rest.
