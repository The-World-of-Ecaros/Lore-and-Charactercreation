### Bonus Proficiencies

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the navigators tools and cartographers tools. If you become a member of the Freemen, you gain a +2 on these rolls for as long as you are in the faction. 

### Plunder and Thunder

When you choose this archetype 3rd level, you gain an additional 10% wealth when you find a treasure hoard. This stacks with other hoard modifiers.  In addition, as a bonus action, you can mark an enemy for death. For 1 minute, you deal sneak attack damage to that creature regardless of circumstances. However, the creature has advantage on attack rolls against you. If this creature is defeated within the minute of this ability, Kaheeli rewards your audacity - you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls for the remainder of the combat encounter. You can use this ability multiple times in the same combat encounter. However, each time the bonus stacks while benefiting from this bonus, each creature you mark has this bonus to attack you as well. Once the combat encounter in which this ability is used ends, you must finish long rest before you can use it again.

### One more Drink!

Beginning at 9th level, you become an adept at drinking in combat, you can consume potions as a bonus action (this doesn't apply to oils). In addition, while wielding a potion, a tankard of ale, wine, mead, grog, or something similar, you can treat the item as a shield, gaining a +2 to AC.

### Blasted and Blasting

Starting at 13th level, whenever you would receive a critical hit from an enemy, you can use a reaction to attack them back with a melee weapon. If the enemy's attack is a ranged attack, you can switch to a ranged weapon, dropping what you had in your hands to equip it, and make an attack against them. This attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 16-20.  You are immune to negative effects of being drunk.

### Edge of the World

At 17th level, you have seen so much, and now this knowledge shows you Kaheeli’s secrets. You are immune to mind-affecting effects, and you gain advantage on saving throws versus all environmental effects, be them magical or mundane.
