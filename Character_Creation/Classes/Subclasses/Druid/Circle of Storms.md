Circle of Storms
================

_The Circle of Storm is dedicated to the wrath of nature in her storms and the call of Kaheeli. Although the Matron of Discord is not an official member of the Green pantheon, they share mutual respect. And when the Green suffered, the wrath of the Goddess of the Sea was personified by the Circle of Storms._
