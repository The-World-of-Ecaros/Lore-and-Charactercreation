Circle of Spires
================

_Druids of the Circle of Spires are dedicated to the advancement of the arcane knowledge of the elves, seeking efficient ways to take from the land without despoiling it. Many saw them as druids that were heretics, but only those with sharp minds and wisdom of what the future will bring could see what the druids of the spires could._
