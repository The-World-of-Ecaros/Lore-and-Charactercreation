School of Cruormancy
--------------------

_"Magic in the blood," a concept sorcerers only believe they understand. But true might comes from the blood itself - you understand this and have learned the secrets of the sanguine._ 

### Spell Book Augmentation

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is halved. 

### Bloodprice

Starting at 2nd level, whenever you cast a spell that would cause an enemy to make a saving throw, you can consume your own hit points to increase the spell's potency. You spend a number of hit points equal to your character level to increase the saving throw DC of the spell by 1. You can do this up to three times per spell.  After you use this feature, you cannot regain hit points for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, as your body is in shock.

### Backlash

At 6th level, whenever you receive damage from a critical hit, you can use your reaction to hard cast a spell of your choice that has a casting time of an action or bonus action.  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### The Master Calls

At 10th level, whenever an enemy takes damage from a spell you hard cast, they also receive an amount of bleeding damage equal to the spell's level. This only applies once per source.

### Fear the Old Blood

At 14th level, you can use your Bloodprice feature any number of times per spell.
