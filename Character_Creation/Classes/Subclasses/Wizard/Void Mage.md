Void Mage
=========

School of Void
--------------

_There is a structure of magic that lies on the other side, a sort of aetheric nothingness, that moves into shape and form. Although it is difficult to manipulate, some mages focus on this intriguing and mysterious force._

### Spell Book Augmentation

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy a spell that deals force damage into your spell book is halved. 

### Forceful Magic

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you gain Eldritch Blast as a cantrip, and it counts as a wizard cantrip for you. Whenever you cast a spell that deals force damage, that spell deals an additional point of damage for each target equal to the level of the spell.

### Grasp of the Void

At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to choose an enemy you can see within 30 feet and pull on its existence from the void. This causes them to have disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks for 1d4 rounds. While the enemy is affected by this feature, you also have disadvantage on such rolls. If the enemy is defeated while under this effect, you gain advantage to these rolls equal to the number of rounds you suffered the disadvantage in this way (minimum of 1 round).  Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Darkwalker

At 10th level, you gain resistance to cold and necrotic damage.  In addition, the first time you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you are reduced to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Forzare’

At 14th level, if you defeat an enemy with a spell that deals force damage, that enemy screams as void energy flows out from it. A Magic Missile spell of the highest level you can cast is cast from the enemy's space, striking out at random enemy targets within range. This feature can trigger itself, but only a maximum number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier in one instance.
