The Evil Eye
============

### The Evil Eye

Your patron is a being of misfortune, misery, sorrow, and devastation. You bring ruin to hope and cast down those who believe that they are destined for success. You are no mere fool with a few magic words. You shall cast an evil eye, and spit your name upon the truth.  **Expanded Spell list**  
1st: _Bane, Disguise Self_  
2nd: _Silence, Pass Without Trace_  
3rd: _Bestow Curse, Slow_  
4th: _Confusion, Greater Invisibility_  
5th: _Modify Memory, Passwall_  
 
 **Evil Eye** Starting at 1st level, your patron grants you the ability to manifest a small portion of its power on the material plane. As a bonus action you can designate a creature you can see within 30 feet to suffer the effects of the Evil Eye. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw against your Warlock spell save DC. For 1 minute, whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes an attack roll or saving throw before this feature ends, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the result from the attack roll or saving throw. This functions identically to the Bane spell (though it does not require concentration) and does not stack with it. This feature cannot be active on more than one creature at a time. This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to your Charisma Modifier (Minimum of 1), regaining expended uses on a long rest.  
 
 **Blessed Gaze** Starting at 6th level, whenever a creature suffers the effects of your Evil Eye ability, you gain a bonus to the next d20 roll of your choice equal to the result of the d4 that creature rolled. This boon fades at the end of your next turn. (It does not stack with itself) Additionally you gain an additional use of Evil Eye per day.  
 
 **Inescapable Sight** Starting at 10th level, whenever your Evil Eye ability activates, the result of the penalty is equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally all creatures that must save against a Bane spell cast use a Warlock spell slot or Eldritch Invocation suffer disadvantage. Additionally you gain an additional use of Evil Eye per day.  
 
 **True Eye** Starting at 14th level, whenever you inflict a creature with your Evil Eye ability, choose one of the following: Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, Saving Throws. The creature suffers disadvantage on any roll of the selected type it makes. This can only be balanced by advantage originating from a magical source or class feature used by a creature of the same proficiency bonus as you. Additionally you gain an additional use of Evil Eye per day.

Evil Eye Eldritch Invocations
=============================

**Eldritch Invocations restricted to Evil Eye Warlocks**  

_Assassin of Fate:_
 Prerequisite: Pact of the Evil Eye, Thief of Five Fates, 7th level. You can cast Bane a number of times per day equal to your proficiency modifier without expending a spell slot or material components. You recover these uses on a long rest.  

_Jinx:_
 Prerequisite: Pact of the Evil Eye, 5th level. You expend your reaction to interfere with the actions of an opponent. Select one enemy creature that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw equal to your Warlock Spell DC. If they fail, they suffer disadvantage on their next d20 roll. Once a creature suffers the effects of this Invocation, they cannot be affected by it again until you take a long rest.  

_Eye See You:_
Prerequisite: Pact of the Evil Eye. A creature under the effects of your evil eye suffers disadvantage on all stealth checks while within 120 feet of you, and you ignore partial cover when targeting that creature.
