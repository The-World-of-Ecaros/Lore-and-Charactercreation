Patrons (WIP)
=============

### What is a Patron?

A Patron is an entity that once was, is trying to become or is for some reason not an aspect of divinity. Many of them are incomplete effigies or are broken concepts through the miasma of the world and its trials. Patrons rely on the direct connection between them and their chosen, however, they are not deities and therefore cannot speak or make their will truly known.
