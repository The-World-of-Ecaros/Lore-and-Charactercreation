Lunar
=====

**Lunar Patron**  In the hours between the twilight, a great creature glides through the air. Žvaigždė (Pronounced ZHE-ve-gs-Des), a creature of the night, stars and watcher of those placed where the material world and the Great Dream blur, is a lunar dragon - quite possibly the last of her kind. Certainly, nobody else has ever seen another - and very precious few have ever even seen Žvaigždė. The only reason any know of her come from footnotes and obscure stories in Sevenic lore. Still, it is said that she visits people as they sleep and their thoughts wander in the Great Dream - or perhaps become lost deep in the dream before their time. She is bound by rules made by her own will and the command of others, as such the limits to what she can do in the material world, kindly and wise as she is, are limited. To that end, she has become able by her own choice or the choice of forces external to make pacts with creatures. There was little she could do ease the burdens of humanoid-kind during the Reckoning, and she has promised to use the limited means available to her to try and help prevent such a thing from coming to pass once again.

 \-\-\-  **Blessing of the Moon**  At first level, you gain the Light and Sacred Flame cantrips, they count as Warlock cantrips for you, but don’t count against your number of Cantrips known. Additionally, when you cast a warlock spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage, you add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or necrotic damage roll of that spell against one of its targets. 

 \-\-\-  **Lunar Armor**  At 6th level, you are able to conjure a spectral armor made of moonlight and starstuff. This armor functions as the spell Mage Armor, setting your AC to 13+your Dexterity modifier. This is considered to also function as Armor of Shadows for purposes of other class/character features.  Additionally, while using this armor, you gain the ability to lash out at enemies with radiant damage. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this ability. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. As a reaction, whenever a creature that you can see successfully damages you with a melee, ranged, or spell attack that targets your armor class, you may cause them to suffer radiant damage, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals half your warlock level. Roll the dice you spend and add them together to determine the total amount of damage.  Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

 \-\-\-  **Grace of the Night**  At 10th level, while your Lunar Armor ability is active, your armor class instead becomes 13+your charisma bonus. Additionally, you may activate your reaction to deal radiant damage from Lunar Armor even when a creature fails to hit you. However, when you choose to do this, the target receives a dexterity saving throw equal to your warlock spell DC to halve the damage.  

 \-\-\-  **Astral Armor**  At 14th level, your innate connection with your patron imbues you with many potent effects while you wear your Lunar Armor:  The armor bonus from Lunar Armor sets your total armor class to 10+your proficiency bonus+your charisma modifier.  You gain resistance to non-magical damage and radiant damage  You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws. If you are already proficient in Dexterity saving throws, you double your proficiency bonus when making them.  Additionally, when you activate your radiant damage pool, the primary target of the attack does not receive a saving throw to resist the damage if you activated the feature in response to a missed attack. When you use it, not only does the target suffer radiant damage, but so do all enemies within 30 feet of the target. These creatures DO receive a Dexterity saving throw to reduce the damage by half.
