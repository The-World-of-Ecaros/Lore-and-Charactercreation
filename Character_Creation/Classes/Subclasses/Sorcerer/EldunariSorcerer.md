Eldunari Sorcerer
================

_Your blood comes from the true dragons of Aekrath - the Eldunari. Your blood screams for their freedom and you will see to its restitution._

* * *

### Eldunari Lord

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.* **Crovux:** Force / Radiant / Primal
* **Vallendrel:** Poison / Acid / Primal
* **Fone:** Cold / Thunder / Primal
* **Eldos Daikura:** Necrotic / Psychic / Primal
* **Rhagdas:** Fire / Radiant / Primal
* **Draaga:** Lightning / Cold / Primal
You can speak, read, and write Draconic (Eldunari). Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with Eldunari, your Proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check. 

### Eldunari Prowess

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Starting at 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.  Additionally, you grow sharp claws that increase in potency as you gain levels using the following progression:* At 1st Level: Your claws deal 1d4 Slashing
* At 6th Level: Your claws deal 1d6 Slashing
* At 14th Level: Your claws deal 1d6 Slashing + extra 1d6 Primal damage
* At 18th Level: Your claws deal 1d6 Slashing + extra 1d6 that is every element your chosen Eldunari governs.
Attacks with these claws use your Strength modifier, and you can use your bonus action to make an attack with a claw. These claw attacks are considered magical for the purpose of bypassing resistances.

### Dominance

Starting at 6th level, you can use an ability associated with the Eldunari you have chosen. Using such abilities costs 1 sorcery point, and they only function with hard casted spells. 

### Crovux

#### Father's Ire

As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt force damage, they must make a Strength saving throw against DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they are forced to kneel (acting as prone) and cannot recover hit points for 2 rounds. 

### Vallendrel

#### Septic Overload

As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt acid or poison damage, they must make a Constitution saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they are poisoned for 1d4 rounds. If they are already poisoned, all enemies within 5 feet of the target are dealt 1d6 poison damage. 

### Fone

#### Absolute Cold

As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt cold damage, they must make a Dexterity saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they are frozen solid and stunned until the end of their next turn. 

### Eldos Daikura

#### Attrition

As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt necrotic damage, the source of the spell cast is healed a number of hit points equal to half the necrotic damage the target takes. 

### Rhagdas

#### Overwhelming Flame

As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt fire damage, they must make a Constitution saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, they take an extra 2d12 fire damage. This can only occur once per source or once per claw attack from the Eldunari Prowess class feature. 

### Draaga

#### The Bends

As a bonus action, you can mark a target for dominance. Until the start of your next turn, if the target is dealt lightning damage, they must make a Constitution saving throw DC 8 + your proficiency + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, their lungs begin to fill with water, preventing speech and the ability to cast spells with verbal components for 1d4 rounds.

### Primal Stride

At 14th level, you are under a constant Freedom of Movement effect.

### Ancient Power

Beginning at 18th level, all spells that you hard cast that deal damage can be changed to primal damage. Your Dominance class feature triggers off of primal damage, and each time you defeat an enemy with primal damage you regain 2 sorcery points as long as the enemy is at least half your level.
