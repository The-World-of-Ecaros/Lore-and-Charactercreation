Scar Seeker
===========

_Scar Seekers are recklessness given an artform. Glory seekers, thrill hunters and most of the time absolutely mad. They revel in the damage thier bodies take, each scar a tale that is never forgotten._

**This Primal Path is available only to the Steton Striders.**

### Dangerous Bravado

At 3rd level, while you're raging and not wearing heavy armor, you lose any resistance to slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage taken, and instead take 50% more damage from those damage types. 

### All In

At 3rd level, you gain a bonus to the damage rolls of melee weapon attacks equal to half of the largest amount of damage you have taken in your current rage if you aren't wearing heavy armor.

### Now or Never

At 6th level, you can choose one of your attacks in an attack action, and that attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 15-20. Using this feature provokes an opportunity attack from your target, and their attack can score a critical hit on a roll of 15-20. The target can make this attack even if they do not have a reaction to use but does use their reaction if they haven't used it already. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short rest.

### Rowdy Rudy

At 10th level, whenever you are defeated, you can instead be reduced to 1 hit point. If you use this feature, all creatures within 30 feet of you gain advantage on attack rolls for 1 round. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Witness Me!

Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to make the Now or Never attack against all enemies within your reach. Doing so provokes an opportunity attack from each creature as a single target would. If you survive this action, you are healed for half of your maximum hit points.
