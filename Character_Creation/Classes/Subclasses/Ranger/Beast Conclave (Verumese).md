Beast Conclave (Ecaraner)
=========================

#### _Written by CrystalZenaida._

_Many rangers are more at home in the wilds than in civilization, to the point where animals consider them kin. Rangers of the Beastborn Conclave develop a close bond with beasts of either land or sky, then further strengthen that bond through the use of magic._

### Beast Companion Path

At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.  
  
With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth an animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. When you select this archetype, you must choose between two paths for your beast companion: Land or Sky. Once you lock in a path, you can select your companion from among the following animals at level 3: 

#### Path of the Land

| Level | Creatures Available |
| --- | --- |
| Level 3 (Lesser) | Ape, Black Bear, Boar, Giant Badger, Giant Weasel, Mule, Panther, Wolf |
| Level 9 (Greater) | Brown Bear, Dire Wolf, Elk, Giant Boar, Giant Hyena, Lion, Snow Leopard, Tiger, War Horse |
| Level 17 (Apex) | Displacer Beast, Owlbear, Winter Wolf |

#### Path of the Sky

| Level | Creatures Available |
| --- | --- |
| Level 3 (Lesser) | Eagle, Falcon, Hawk, Owl, Raven, Vulture |
| Level 9 (Greater) | Giant Eagle, Giant Falcon, Giant Hawk, Giant Owl, Giant Raven, Giant Vulture |
| Level 17 (Ace) | Griffon, Manticore, Giant Peryton |

  
At Ranger levels 9 and 17, you can choose to branch out from a previous selection of animals to a newer group as you master your connection beasts to the point where even monstrosities follow your command. Once you select a new group, it is locked in and you can not summon animals from the previous group.  
  
The only way you can change back to a different group and/or path is through Academies.  
  
**All the companions available are different from their base 5e counterparts. The custom stats of these companion creatures can be found in a [google doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19RQa7quDmkCxg2PJKFwiZqNEaajM2Vxs050S2Mm9hqs/edit?usp=sharing).** The base stats of these custom creatures are based on the first ranger level of which these companions appear and the Companion’s Bond benefits.  
  
At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time and can only select animals from the path and group you’ve chosen.  
  
If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.  
  
If you use this ability to return a former animal companion to life while you have a current animal companion, your current companion leaves you and is replaced by the restored companion.  
  

### Companion's Bond

Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.  
  
The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.  
  
The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.  
  
When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.  
  
Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and on their attack’s damage roll. However, should you equip barding to your companion, they lose their proficiency bonus to AC.  
  
To determine the AC of your Animal Companion, it’s: **10 + your proficiency bonus + your companion’s Dexterity modifier**.  
  
To determine saving throw DC for some companion abilities, it’s: **8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier aligned to your companion’s effect**.  
  
Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.  
  
For each Ranger level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. However, should you branch out to a new group of beasts within your path, the previous group’s additional hit dice do not carry over.  
  
Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement or feat from your Ranger levels, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. However, should you branch out to a new group of beasts within your path, the previous group’s Ability Score Improvements do not carry over.  
  
[**Here is a chart that shows how your companion's ASI progression works**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q8ujB3hl2rR2mAG_ssF0pXyqntxgeUjlzwNMMZmqCj8/edit?usp=sharing)  
  
The only way you can reassign your Companion’s ASIs is through Academies.  
  
Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."  
  
Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.

### Coordinated Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you and your animal companion form a more potent fighting force. When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can either attack twice, instead of once, or, if your companion can see you, you can forfeit one of your attacks to have your companion use its reaction to make a melee attack.  This does not stack with the Extra Attack class feature of other classes.  Your companion’s attacks are considered magical for the purposes of bypassing resistance.

### Beast’s Defense

At 7th level, while your companion can see you, it has advantage on all saving throws.

* * *

### Storm of Claws and Fangs

At 11th level, your animal companion can use its action to make a melee attack against each creature of its choice within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target.

* * *

### Superior Beast’s Defense

At 15th level, whenever an attacker that your companion can see hits it with an attack, it can use its reaction to halve the attack's damage against it.
