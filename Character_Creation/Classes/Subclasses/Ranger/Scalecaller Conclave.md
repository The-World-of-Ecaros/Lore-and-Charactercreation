Scalecaller Conclave
====================

#### _Written by CrystalZenaida._

_Many rangers are more at home in the wilds than in civilization, to the point where animals consider them kin. Rangers of the Scalecaller Conclave develop a close bond with a scaled beast, then further strengthen that bond through the use of magic._

### Scaled Companion Genome

At 3rd level, you learn to use your magic to create a powerful bond with a creature of the natural world.  
  
With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth a scaled animal from the wilderness to serve as your faithful companion. This companion evolves and adapts rapidly as it fights alongside its master. When you select this archetype, you must choose between three base genomes for your beast companion: Saurian, Piscine, and Wyvern. These genomes determine what stats and abilities your companion starts with, in addition to the abilities you can choose using evolution points you receive at each Ranger level. These are the base stats and abilities of each genome:  

| Genome | Base Stats and Abilities (At Level 3 with Proficiency Bonus +2) |

Once you select a genome, your companion’s base Ability Scores are locked in. At Ranger Levels 7 and 15, you can select any of the remaining genomes at the expense of losing 2 hit dice for your companion and in exchange you receive the genome’s limbs, base abilities, base attacks, and access to their exclusive abilities you can acquire with evolution points. Or you can continue with your initial genome(s) and add 1 hit dice to your companion’s hit dice total. 

#### Evolutions

 Your scaled companion receives a number of evolution points that can be spent to give them new abilities, powers, and other upgrades. **These abilities, called evolutions, can be reselected whenever you gain a new ranger level, but they are otherwise set once you play in a session.** Some evolutions require that the scaled companion have a specific genome and/or the Ranger be of a specific level before they can be chosen.  Evolutions are grouped by their cost in evolution points. Evolution points cannot be saved. All of the points must be spent whenever you gain a new Ranger level. Unless otherwise noted, each evolution can only be selected once.

At the end of the 8 hours, your animal companion appears and gains all the benefits of your Companion's Bond ability. You can have only one animal companion at a time.  If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. With 8 hours of work and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food, you call forth your companion's spirit and use your magic to create a new body for it. You can return an animal companion to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.  When resummoning your animal companion in this way, you can reselect the number and/or type of limbs your companion has from what's available from your companion's genome(s). 

### Companion's Bond

Your animal companion gains a variety of benefits while it is linked to you.  The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.  The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.  When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.  Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and on their attack’s damage roll. However, should you equip barding to your companion, they lose their proficiency bonus to AC as well as their Natural Armor bonus if they have one.  To determine the AC of your Animal Companion, it’s: **10 + your proficiency bonus + your companion’s Dexterity modifier**.  If your companion has natural armor, it’s: **Natural Armor + your proficiency bonus + your companion’s dexterity modifier**.  To determine saving throw DC for some companion abilities, it’s: **8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier aligned to your companion’s effect**.  Your animal companion gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. It also becomes proficient with all saving throws.  For each Ranger level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly. However, should you add a new genome to your companion at levels 7 and 15, your companion’s hit dice total is reduced by 2 for each new genome. However, should you continue with your initial genome(s), add 1 hit dice to your companion’s hit dice total.  Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement or feat from your Ranger levels, the cap of Ability Score Improvement evolutions you can take increases by 1. With the Ability Score Improvement evolution, your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.  Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, "The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life."  Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.

### Coordinated Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you and your animal companion form a more potent fighting force. When you use the Attack action on your turn, you can either attack twice, instead of once, or, if your companion can see you, you can forfeit one of your attacks to have your companion use its reaction to make a melee attack.  This does not stack with the Extra Attack class feature of other classes.  Your companion’s attacks are considered magical for the purposes of bypassing resistance.

* * *

### Improved Scaled Companion

At 7th level, you can select any remaining genome for your animal companion you haven’t locked in and receive their limbs, base abilities, and access to their exclusive abilities you can acquire with evolution points.

At 15th level, you can select any remaining genome for your animal companion you haven’t locked in and receive their limbs, base abilities, and access to their exclusive abilities you can acquire with evolution points. Once you lock in a new genome, your companion’s hit dice total is reduced by 2.  Or you can instead choose to forfeit the new genome and add 1 hit dice to your companion’s current hit dice total.
