Sanguine Knight
===============

_The lords of the night have chosen you to protect the antideluvians and as such you stand ready, prepared to sacrifice your body for power and call to the powers of the Sanguine._

### Suffering Sword

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can only use weapons that deal slashing damage. If you use a weapon that deals Slashing or another damage type, you can only choose slashing. When you deal slashing damage with such weapons, you deal an additional 1 bleed damage to the target. 

### Sanguine Boon

At 3rd level, whenever you are healed, if you would be healed to your maximum hit points, you can convert any leftover healing as temporary hit points. You cannot gain more than 3 times your character level of temporary hit points in this way. You cannot gain temporary hit points from this class feature if you already have any temporary hit points at all.

### Bloodwell

At 7th level, whenever you score a critical hit against an enemy, or you hit a bleeding enemy with a total bleed stack of 5 or more, you can activate your Second Wind class feature (no action required) even if it has already been used. If you do, your allies within 15 feet of you are also healed for the same amount. Using this ability, removes all bleed damage from the target.

### Running Red

At 10th level, your speed increases by 5 feet for each bleeding enemy you can see. Movement augmented in this way does not provoke opportunity attacks.

### Bloodsight

At 15th level, you gain a lifesense of up to 30 feet, but only for living creatures with blood.  You can read further about lifesense in [Ecaros Rules](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/Ecaros-rules-article#Lifesense).

### Antideluvian Theft

At 18th level, whenever you deal damage with a weapon, if the target is already bleeding, you heal for a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier.
