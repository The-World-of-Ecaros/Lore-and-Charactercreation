Aden’ka’ael (Moon Warrior)
==========================

_The warriors of Eldasharkai learn many different forms of death and destruction. One such fighting style is focused on the use of the Falchion. Using its sweeping motions to imitate the phases of the moon and in it, a deadly dance is learned._

### Moonlight Sonata

Starting at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, while you wield a [falchion](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/improved-armory-article#Falchion), you can move up to 10 feet each time you deal damage to a hostile creature with this weapon. This movement does not count against your speed.  Whenever you move at least 20 feet in a round, your next attack with a falchion deals an additional +2 damage. To gain this bonus, the movement must all be made where you have not yet moved this round. You gain this additional damage only once per round.

### Punishing Moon

At 7th level, while wielding a falchion, you can use a bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of a hostile creature you can see of your choice. You can then make a free weapon attack against that creature with a falchion.

### Bad Moon Dance

### Crescent Call

At 18th level, you can use an action to make an attack with a falchion against all hostile creatures within a 30 feet cone from your position. You can move up to and attack each hostile creature in the cone's area. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
