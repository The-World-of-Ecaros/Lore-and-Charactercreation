Rytherian Fighter
=================

_This fighter uses the practice of perfect timing and prediction to overcome their foes, attacking at just the right time and just the right place._

### Perfect Time

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, when a combat encounter starts, you gain the following effects based on the number of rounds that have passed. These effects stack.

* **1st round:** +1 bonus to attack rolls
* **2nd round:** +1 bonus to AC
* **3rd round:** +2 bonus to damage rolls
* **4th round:** You lose all gained benefits from the 1st to 3rd rounds, and gain disadvantage on attack rolls

After the 4th round, the sequence starts over, and you gain the 1st round effect again on the next round.

### Power of Prediction

At 7th level, you can use a bonus action to call out the next immediate maneuver of up to 3 enemies you can see within 15 feet. These maneuvers can be: attack, move, spell cast, or disengage, and you choose one for each enemy. If your prediction is correct, you gain a benefit based on the maneuver made:

* **Attack:** +1 bonus to AC until the end of your next turn.
* **Move:** You can make an opportunity attack against the enemy as soon as the enemy moves, not requiring them to move out of your reach first. If this opportunity attack hits, you regain the use of your reaction.
* **Spell Cast:** You gain advantage on saving throws against spells until the end of your next turn.
* **Disengage:** You heal for 1d10 hit points.

You can use this ability three times, regaining all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.  In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Martial) checks. You can read further about the Martial skill in [Ecaros Rules](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/Ecaros-rules-article#Martial%20Skill).

### Battle Rhythm

At 10th level, whenever you defeat an enemy, you can freely attack another enemy you have not yet attacked this round. This cannot occur more than twice a round.

### Ebb and Flow

At 15th level, as a free action at the start of your turn, you can choose to double the bonuses you gain from your Perfect Time and Power of Prediction features. If you do, you receive a penalty equal to the bonuses during your next turn.

### Clutch Moment

At 18th level, whenever you hit an attack but before you roll damage, you can choose to have the attack be a critical hit. If you do, you roll the attack's extra damage dice three additional times. You can use this feature once, and regain the use when the combat encounter ends.
