Fate

### Fate

Of each life, a thread is spun. These threads of many colors, sizes, and makes, are all woven into the tapestry of fate. But threads are not an unbroken line, the will of the living twist, turn, tie these threads and cause them to be frayed, knotted, and sundered. No prophecy is ever entirely true, entirely false. All threads contain some measure of truth, some grain of a lie. Fate is written by those with the will to grab these threads and use them to chart a course for themselves and their fellows. As an agent of fate, you have the power to see visions of the future and manipulate them as you see fit. You may spare them for a time, but none are spared forever.

### Bonus Proficiency and Cantrip

The providence of fate allows you to spin the threads in your favor and see the truth of others. You gain proficiency in the Insight skill and gain the Guidance spell as a cantrip known. 

### Not Today

You know when it is your time to die, even if it remains hauntingly hazy. Still, it gives you some ability to endure deadly blows. When the damage from a single instance of damage would cause you to go unconscious or die, you may use your reaction to reduce the damage you suffer by an amount equal to 2+your proficiency modifier+your wisdom modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 2nd level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Channel Divinity: Fateful Girding

Starting at second level you can channel the forces of fate to allow your allies the power to better shape the tapestry.  As an action, you present your holy symbol and cause you and all allies that you can see to gain temporary hit points equal to 1d8+ Your Wisdom Modifier+ Your Proficiency Bonus. These temporary hit points remain until you successfully complete a short rest.  Additionally, whenever they roll a d20 they roll with advantage. This effect fades at the end of your next turn. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 6th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Uncertain Prophecy

Starting at 6th level, you can exert some small measure of control over the threads of fate. Whenever any creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or saving throw, you may use your reaction to add a bonus or penalty to the roll equal to 1d4. This does not stack with the bonus or penalty given by the spells Bless or Bane, respectively. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 8th level, you gain both of the following features from your Divine Domain. 

#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 

#### Ill Omen

Starting at 8th level, whenever you successfully hit a hostile creature with a cantrip, or it fails it's saving throw against your cantrip, it suffers disadvantage on its saving throw against the next spell of first level or higher you target it with. If this spell has an area of effect, only that creature gains disadvantage. This effect ends at the end of your next turn. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 17th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Fate's Favored

Your ability to weave the threads of fate allows you to traverse the most optimistic threads of your fate and the fate of those around you. Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate a 60 foot aura that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another action. All allies within the aura, including yourself, are immune to disadvantage. This action can be taken an unlimited amount of times.
