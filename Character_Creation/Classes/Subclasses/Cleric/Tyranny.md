### With An Iron Fist

You gain proficiency with heavy armor and deal an extra +1 point of damage with unarmed strikes while wearing heavy armor. 

### Taskmaster

At 1st level, as an action you can coerce allies to comply with your orders, and for enemies to think twice about attacking you. Choose a number of enemies up to half your proficiency bonus within 60 ft. that you can see. Your allies have advantage on attack rolls against the chosen enemies, but disadvantage on attack rolls against all other creatures until the end of their next turn. The chosen enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of their next turn. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain these uses after a long rest. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 2nd level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Channel Divinity: Demand Tribute

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to rightfully take what is yours from the unworthy.  As an action, you present your holy symbol, affecting all other creatures within 30 ft. of you with this ability. For the rest of the encounter, you can potentially take benefits from the affected creatures in one of three ways:* The next time an affected creature would gain advantage on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, they lose that advantage, and you gain advantage of the same type the next time you would roll it (if a creature loses advantage on an attack roll, you gain advantage on the next attack roll you make).
* The next time an affected creature would receive healing, they instead only receive half of it, and you heal for the same amount that they lost.
* The next time an affected creature would cast a spell targeting only you, you regain a spell slot of the same level as the spell cast on you.
You can receive a benefit from Demand Tribute in this way only once. At 6th level, you can receive two benefits, and three at 18th level. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 6th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Oppression

Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Furthermore, creatures affected by Taskmaster have disadvantage on their saves against your spells and other domain abilities. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 8th level, you gain a feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Dominating Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can cause the attack to inflict a Command on the target, as the spell. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 17th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Kneel To Your God

Once per turn, you may cast the spell Hold Monster as a bonus action on any creature affected by Taskmaster. A creature that fails its save against this effect of Hold Monster is also forced to kneel to you â€“ it is rendered prone.
