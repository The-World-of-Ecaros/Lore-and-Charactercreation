Rage

### Rage

Whoever appeals to mercy against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward. Whoever cannot take care of themselves without mercy is both. For the wounded shall say to their enemy, “If I live, I will kill you. If I die, you are forgiven.” What was left broken, and unspoken, will be mended by violence, and the flames of anger endlessly kindled.
