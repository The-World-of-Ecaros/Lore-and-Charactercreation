### An Imbalance of Humors

Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use your action to touch a willing creature to give it resistance to acid, cold, fire, or lightning damage. If you choose resistance to acid or lightning damage, the creature also gains vulnerability to the other. If you choose resistance to cold or fire damage, the creature also gains vulnerability to the other. The resistance and vulnerability both last for 1 minute. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom modifier, and regain these uses after a long rest. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 2nd level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Channel Divinity: Hysteria

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to spread madness among the ranks.  As an action, you may present your holy symbol and invoke hysteria on creatures with 30 ft. of you. All those affected must make Wisdom saving throws. If a creature fails, they lose the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all other creatures it can see as enemies until the end of their turn. Whenever an affected creature chooses a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it's using. If an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the creature must make that attack if it is able to.

At the start of your turn, you may choose to give yourself advantage on every roll you would make for the rest of your turn.

You may use this ability once per short rest.
