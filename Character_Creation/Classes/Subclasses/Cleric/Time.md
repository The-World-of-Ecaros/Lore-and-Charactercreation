The riddle of time is one of the oldest mysteries of all creation, all the more tragic since its near destruction. The shattered pieces fade in and out providing power to those that know how to capture it.

### Shattered Time

After a long rest, you can roll a number of d20s equal to your wisdom modifier. You can "store" these d20s to be used to replace a die roll of an attack roll, saving throw or skill check. Replacing these d20s is a reaction. This can affect yourself or an ally within 20 feet. These rolls last until a long rest.

#### Channel Divinity: Time Splinter

At 2nd level, you may use your Channel Divinity to vanish within a splinter of time. As a reaction after you suffer damage or are forced to make a saving throw, you can vanish from time, becoming temporarily immune until the start of your next turn. During this time, you cannot be targeted or seen. After which, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that is within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen freely if more than one space is equally near).
