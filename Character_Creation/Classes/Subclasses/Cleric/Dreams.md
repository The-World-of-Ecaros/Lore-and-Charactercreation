### Divine Domain Feature

At 2nd level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Channel Divinity: Day Dream

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.  As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you.  For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion's space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you have advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 6th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Dream Form

As a bonus action, you may enter a state that is between both the dream realm and the waking realm, granting yourself resistance to all damage and advantage on attack rolls. This lasts for one minute or until you are subject to a critical hit. This ability can only be used once per long rest.

#### Walk Back Through

Whenever you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you fall unconscious as normal. In 3 rounds or if you would die, you instead, are healed to half your maximum hit points and may act normally. Once used this ability cannot be used again until you complete a long rest.
