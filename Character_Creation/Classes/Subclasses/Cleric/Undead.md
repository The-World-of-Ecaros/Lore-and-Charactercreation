Undead

### Undead

The cycle of life and death is not something that should be kept sacred, but experimented with. You have learned to disrupt this cycle, conjuring spirits and animating corpses to fulfill your will. 

#### Deities

Crowley, The Seven 

#### Domain Spell

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.  
1st - _Inflict Wounds, Ray of Sickness_  
3rd - _Darkness, Misty Step_  
5th - _Animate Dead, Vampiric Touch_  
7th - _Blight, Phantasmal Killer_  
9th - _Danse Macabre, Negative Energy Flood_  

### Bonus Cantrip

At 1st level, you learn one necromancy cantrip from any spell list. For you, this counts a Cleric cantrip. 

### Spectral Smite

At 1st level, you can conjure vile spirits from the Ethereal plane to lash out at your foes. When you use your action to cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you may use your bonus action make a melee or ranged spell attack versus one creature you can see within 30 feet. If it hits, that creature suffers necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom Modifier.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 2nd level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Channel Divinity: Conjure Undead

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to summon a horde of skeletons.  As an action, you create three horrid skeletons that last 1 minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). The skeletons appear in three adjacent unoccupied spaces that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each skeleton has AC equal to 10 + your Wisdom modifier, Hit Points equal to 3 x your cleric level, and uses your saving throws. If a skeleton is dropped to 0 hit points, it crumbles to dust.  When you use this ability, you can make a melee spell attack for each skeleton against a creature within 5 feet of each of them. On a hit, the targets take magical slashing damage equal to 1d8 + Wisdom modifier.  As an action on each of your turns, you can move each of the skeletons up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120 feet of you. You may then repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of each of the skeletons. The skeletons may move away from one another, can attack separate targets, and take up medium spaces as normal. These skeletons cannot take their own reactions, but you may spend a reaction to grant one of them an opportunity attack if one such attack is provoked. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 6th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Corpse Companion

At 6th level, you learn to raise a permanent undead minion to do your bidding.  With an 8 hour ritual and the expenditure of 50 gp worth of rare herbs, you raise a single medium humanoid corpse to serve as your companion. Select your companion from one of the two following creatures: Skeleton or Zombie. At the end of the 8 hours, your corpse companion is raised. You can have only one corpse companion at a time.  If your corpse companion is ever slain, you may reactivate the vile magics within it to reanimate it. With an 8 hours ritual and the expenditure of 25 gp worth of rare herbs, you call forth your companion and reanimate its lifeless corpse. You must possess the companionâ€™s body in order to reanimate it in this way.  Your corpse companion gains the following bonuses while it is controlled by you:  The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion does not act on its own.  Your companion has base hit points equal to 5 times your cleric level. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, it makes death saving throws as normal. It has proficiency with simple weapons and light armor, but has no attunement slots. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, a corpse companion also adds its proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls and gains proficiency with all saving throws. Finally, you may increase one of its ability scores by 2, or increase two ability scores 1.  Your corpse companion cannot spend hit dice or be healed by any effect that does not heal undead. It returns to full hit points on a long rest as normal. Whenever you cast Inflict Wounds on your corpse companion, it heals a number of hit points equal to the damage that would have been dealt rather than taking damage.  For each cleric level you gain after 6th, your corpse companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points by 5 + its Constitution Modifier.  Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your companion's abilities also improve. Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your companion can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 8th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 

### Divine Domain Feature

At 17th level, you gain the following feature from your Divine Domain. 

#### Undead Lord

At 17th level, any undead creatures you animate or summon with a necromancy spell add your proficiency bonus to their saving throws, attack rolls, damage rolls, and AC. This does not apply to your Corpse Companion.  As an action, you may destroy your Corpse Companion, rendering it to dust. When you do so, you regain a number of Hit Points equal to the number of Hit Points it had remaining. Any equipment your companion had falls to its space unharmed. This ability can be used at any range, but you and your corpse companion must be on the same plane.
