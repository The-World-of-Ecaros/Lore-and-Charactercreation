### Embodiment of the Law

At 6th level, you become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.  If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action.  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

The damage is Psychic. This ability can only be used again whenever you long rest. Chaotic creatures cannot be healed by this ability and lawful creatures cannot be damaged by it.
