Oath of the Eldunari
====================

_Those that swear fealty to the Eldunari will find themselves infused with the power of the Primal Dragons, a power worthier than any deity. Those that follow this Oath care for the power of the self and the unprejudiced authority of facts._

### Oath of the Eldunari

#### Tenets of the Eldunari

Those that follow the path of the Eldunari hold these four simple truths above all else.

* The strong impose their will, the weak do not. Good, evil, chaos, law - these things are only possible through might.
* Lies are the tools of the weak. Embrace what you are and feel not ashamed.
* It is naive to believe peace will last. Strive to control your world.
* Serve the Eldunari, and punish the usurper dragons - those that would steal the world for themselves.

#### Channel Divinity: Cull the Meek

Whenever you defeat an enemy with a melee weapon attack, you can use your Channel Divinity as a reaction. If you do, make a melee weapon attack another enemy creature within your reach. If you defeat this creature, you can repeat this process until you do not defeat a creature you've attacked. Each enemy creature you defeat while using this ability gives you a stacking +1 bonus to weapon damage rolls. You can move as normal between these attacks if you have movement to spend. 

#### Channel Divinity: Predator, or Prey?

As a bonus action, you bolster the resolve of your allies, granting advantage to the next saving throw they make within 1 minute. This effect ends early for an ally if they willingly move away from an enemy.
