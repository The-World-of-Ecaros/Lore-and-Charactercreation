Oath of the Time Warden
=======================

**_This subclass is a work in progress, and is not currently available for play. There will be an announcement when this subclass is released._**  _There are those that serve Raquel directly in her impossible task of fixing time. They serve as wardens against its manipulations and indeed seek to correct jaunts and portals into the past and visions of the future. Prophecy and sight may reveal hints to a future impossible to realize. Only by the actions of these protectors can such impossible branches be avoided and doom diverted._

### Oath of the Time Warden

#### Tenets of the Time Warden

The Tenets of the Time Warden is held to keep the manipulations of time intact and to safeguard the errant use of such magic.

* **_The Present is the Only Gift._** Do not benefit or allow others to use revelations about the future to augment their actions.
* **_Protect the Undetermined._** A fate unknown is a blessed thing, the purest form of freedom. Keep safe this holy ignorance whenever you can.
* **_Protect the Sanctity of the Past._** What has happened is paramount and changing it is blasphemous. Disallow any changing of the past, unless it is by the blessed hands of Raquel or her servants.
* **_Joy for All._** Always the new, unknown and exciting. Raquelâ€™s gnomish nature is reflected in this tenet, that you should always offer a smile or a joke, for laughter is your greatest weapon.

#### Channel Divinity: Time Splinter

You disappear from existence until the start of your next turn. Doing so causes your hit points to be restored as though you are benefiting from a short rest, allowing you to spend hit dice as normal. You reappear at an available square of your choice within 30 feet.

### Quicksilver Aura

At 7th level, the windings of time quicken around you, granting you and your allies that start their turn within 10 feet of you a 10-foot bonus to speed.  At 18th level, the range and bonus to speed from this aura both increase to 30 feet.

* * *

### Clockstop

At 15th level, your power over time and service to Raquel grants you access to directly manipulate it, allowing you to cast the spell Time Stop.  Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until a week has passed.

* * *

### Timewalker

At 20th level, you become one of the direct servants of Raquel and walk with a fraction of her power. As an action, you can magically undergo a transformation, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

* You gain an additional action on your turn. This functions like the Haste spell, and it can be in effect at the same time as Haste.
* Attacks against you have disadvantage, as your form is semi-permanent.
* As a bonus action you can teleport an ally you can see to any point you can see within 120 feet. This also heals the ally for 10d6 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
