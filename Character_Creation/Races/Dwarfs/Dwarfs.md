Dwarfs
=======

In the first era, as the Lizardfolk retreated to their mystic jungles and the elves spread across the rest of the surface, it was the Dwarfs that took their home in the mountains and the unknown wonders below. It was here that the Dwarfs developed the art of forging, of trade, of travel; their culture. So deep did the Dwarfs dig, that another world was made. A world formed from the caverns and crevices from below the surface. It was here, in the depths of the dark, that the Dwarfs longed to see the light above, but would not abandon what they had created. And so one among them, who would soon become their king, crafted for them this light out of a mysterious metal found within the deepest part of the earth. It was here that Astaroth created the Dark Sun.  This sun forged in the dark brought light, wealth, and energy to the Dwarfs deep below. But there were some who saw; some who believed that the light of this sun carried with it a great cost, for Dwarfs under it began to form ashen skin. They began to forget the old kingdom and the old hymns. Astaroth looked down upon his people, not with a soft hand, but a hard one. He believed that iron was better than the soft flesh, and thus he ruled with a fist of iron. It was then that the Dwarfs of Krazax abandoned their underworld kin. As they departed to the surface, it was they that sealed the Deep Gate in the hopes that Astaroth and all that followed him would not threaten the surface or the peaceful people of the mountains.  In the next era, the Dwarfs of Krazax flourished, and spread throughout what is known as modern Krazax. Here the mountain kingdoms flourished and prospered. However, this peace was occasionally interrupted by wars with the goblinoid tribes and the tyrannical giants. Here the Dwarfs withstood the test of time building great structures, producing immortal art, weapons, armor, and machinery. It was here, during this time, that the Dwarfs witnessed the confrontation between the elves, dragons, and Lizardfolk. The Dwarfs remained isolated within their mountain homes, perfectly context with the other races warring with another. Peace was attempted, but a betrayal was committed. A meeting between the Dwarfs, elves, and all leaders of the minor races were betrayed by poison and conspiracy. And thus the enmity between the Dwarfs and elves was manifested.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy

Dwarfs have short statures and abnormally hairy bodies.  Duergar are Dwarfs that chose to stay behind with Astaroth during the great exodus to the surface. Their exposure to the Dark Sun have granted them many gifts. They possess innate magics and superior darkvision. In addition, Astaroth’s teachings have made them resilient to hardship and inefficiency. However, it is difficult for them to see in the light of the true sun.  Mountain Dwarfs are the most common form of dwarf found within the mountain kingdoms and that most look to when one thinks of Dwarfs. The most iconic part of mountain Dwarfs are their dedication to their beards, which has led to the stereotype of a dwarf’s beard. Their beards are often braided, bejeweled, adorned, and otherwise stylized heavily.  Hill Dwarfs are much like mountain Dwarfs accept that they live in the hilly terrain in the lowlands of Krazax among their human neighbors. These Dwarfs tend to style their beards similarly to their human neighbors, whether whimsical or fantastical, with large mustaches. While their mountain kin focus more on the forge, hill Dwarfs tend to focus more on the trade that the forge produces.
