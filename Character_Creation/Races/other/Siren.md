**Ability Score Improvement –** Your Charisma score increases by 2 and you gain +1 to an ability score based on your choice of subrace.  **Age –** A Siren is a species of aberration that seeks to feed on the emotions of other creatures and when possible, spawn themselves from such emotions. Sirens can live up to 500 years.  **Alignment –** Most Sirens have a chaotic alignment, the conventions of law limiting to their feeding. However, good and evil is dependent on the sirens cultural sub-type, but Sirens of course can choose their own paths.  **Type –** Sirens are humanoids with the aberration subtype.  **Size –** Sirens are on average the same size as humans. Your size is Medium.  **Speed –** Sirens have a base speed of 30ft.  **Languages –** You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon.  **Darkvision –** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cannot discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.  **The Voice –** All Sirens can sing, indeed it is their method of feeding and a great tool to their survival. As such, all Sirens have proficiency in the performance skill.  **The Feeding –** Sirens feed on the powerful emotions of those around them, with each sub-type of Siren preferring to gain sustenance from a particular emotion, and usually maneuver or manipulate their prey in order to achieve the optimal conditions.  As a bonus action, a Siren can begin to sing through The Voice in order to draw sustenance out from a target creature they can see afflicted with their preferred status condition (see each sub-race for their chosen status effect), gaining 10 Temporary Hit Points as a result.  This method of feeding counts as enough sustenance to last a Siren a full week, though they still require water as normal.  Once you have used this ability, you must complete a Long Rest before you can use it again.  **Communion -** Upon completion of a short or long rest, you can choose a number of allies up to your proficiency modifier to commune with, granting them a boon for combat. This boon is lost upon the target completing another short or long rest.  As an action, you can call out and activate the effects of the communion on any effected ally within 60ft that can hear you. This benefit lasts for 1 minute.  The communion abilities are detailed in the subraces.
