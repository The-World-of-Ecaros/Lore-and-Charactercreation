### Subraces

#### Gogglers

 **Ability Score Racial Traits –** A Goggler increases their Wisdom score by 1.  **Otherworldly Perception –** As a bonus action, the Goggler can flick a special lens upon their eye that allows them to see beyond the natural realm. For the next hour, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent. You can use this ability once per short rest.  **Whispered Reality –** A Goggler has lost a sense of their self from the pain and mental anguish they have suffered, but from this loss they have learned to see things in a new light, and to create their own reality. You suffer disadvantage against any Madness effect, but you can cast silent image with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast phantasmal force with it, and starting at 5th level, you can also cast major image with it. Once you cast a spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
