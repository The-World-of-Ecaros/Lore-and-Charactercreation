Revenant
========

A mockery of life, a Revenant is an undead husk of a formerly living creature. Revenants require battle to survive and thus feed off a small portion of the energy that a living being released once it is killed. Without a constant supply of combat and violence a Revenant will cease to be.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy

Revenants resemble the creature they once were but have few of the basic internal biological functions their body once did, and those that remain are usually just to maintain a sense of equilibrium.

### Biological Traits

A revenant is undead and have many features as expected of an undead. A revenant still needs to breathe, this is for its mind not its body, as it will lose its grip on its body and be destroyed if it does not keep breathing. A revenant does not need to eat or drink anymore however.

### Genetics and Reproduction

### Growth Rate & Stages

_**The race below is a race only available through special circumstances and cannot be chosen at character creation.  You may only ever play as a revenant once as a player.**_  **Age –** Revenants live only as long as they continue to kill worthy adversaries. Their life is extended by the purpose of battle, righteous or otherwise. Many dedicate themselves to a purpose, in which they throw all of themselves into it.  **Alignment –** A Revenants alignment often times resembles that which it had at death.  **Size –** Revenants maintain the size they had when they were alive  **Breathing Corpse –** A revenant is undead and is affected by negative effects and positive effects that affect undead, any healing the Revenant receives is always halved, regardless of its source. They however cannot be turned or commanded with the relative class features to those effects. A revenant still needs to breath, this is for its mind not its body, as it will lose its grip on its body and be destroyed if it does not keep breathing. (They suffocate like everyone else.) A revenant does not need to eat or drink anymore however.  **On the Edge –** The revenant's soul is just on the edge of passing and just within its bodies reach. On a death saving throw, if a Revenant rolls a 15 – 20, they are healed by 1 hitpoint and may act normally. If they roll a 1 on a death saving throw, they are automatically destroyed.  **Battle will sustain thee –** Whenever the Revenant gets a KILLING BLOW on an enemy, they gain 1 soul point. As time passes the Revenant loses soul points. If a revenant does not have enough soul points equal to that which is lost, they must make a death saving throw to continue living. They must make this save for each soul point they don't have. If they fail three of these before the next time they gain the KILLING BLOW, they are destroyed. If they roll a 1 during these, they are instantly destroyed.  **What is Dead, may never die –** Revenants are immune to death effects and necrotic damage, but they may never be revived or resurrected again.

**Languages.** Revenants speak whatever languages they knew when they died and they gain [Necril](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/necril-article).
