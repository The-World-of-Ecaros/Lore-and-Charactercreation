Dhampir
=======

Dhampirs are humanoids that have a partial connection to the curse of Vampirism. While not full vampires themselves, they carry many of the same burdens but also have some of the same gifts.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy

Dhampir stand near the same height of most humans, rarely standing taller than a height of 6 feet.

### Ecology and Habitats

Dhampir can live anywhere that other humanoids live, but personal aversions or the superstition of others may cause them to seek isolated, private or seedy places.

### Dietary Needs and Habits

Omnivorous, but must periodically consume the blood of humanoids to avoid physical and mental illness.

Additional Information

**Age –** Similarly to humans, Dhampir reach adulthood in their late teens, but due to their curse live no longer than 140 years.  **Alignment –** Due to the nature of their curse, Dhampir tend to be more self centered and focused more on their own personal gain and survival. Some bend the law or take advantage of it to fit their needs, while others completely circumvent the law to fulfill their desires. There are however, few Dhampir that seek to redeem themselves from their curse, taking selfless actions and only partaking in blood when necessary.  **Size –** Dhampir stand near the same height of most humans, rarely standing taller than a height of 6 feet. Dhampir weigh an average of 150 pounds and have a size of Medium.  **Darkvision –** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  **Sunlight Sensitivity –** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.  **Vampiric Guile –** You gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion.  **Blood Curse –** Once per week, Dhampirs must partake in the blood of another humanoid in order to replace their own blood to survive. If a Dhampir fails to do so, they gain one point of exhaustion per day afterwards that cannot be removed until they consume the blood of another humanoid.  **Fangs –** Your fangs are a natural weapon which you can use to make unarmed strikes. Your fangs count as a finesse weapon, and as such if you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier.  **Invigorate –** Once per long rest, when you successfully attack a living humanoid with blood using your fangs, you can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself (no action required). Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total. Using this ability counts as a source of blood for the blood curse effect.

#### Subraces

All Dhampir have different aspects of their curse more pronounced, creating two distinct types: Feral Dhampirs, and Royal Dhampirs. 

#### Feral Dhampir

**Ability Score Improvement –** Your Dexterity score increases by +2 and your Charisma score increases by +1.  **Blood Frenzy –** Consuming the blood of the living in excess imbues you with power, and embracing it allows for you to enter a state of rage and fervor. Whenever you successfully strike a creature with blood using your fangs, you may choose to enter a Blood Frenzy. Until the end of your turn, you may use a bonus action to make a fang attack against a target. If you succeed on this or any other fang attack on your turn, you may extend the duration of your frenzy by one additional round. If your frenzy was extended by one or more rounds, you gain one point of exhaustion when your frenzy ends. 

#### Royal Dhampir

**Ability Score Improvement –** Your Charisma score increases by +2 and your Dexterity score increases by +1.  **Predatory Charm –** You can magically beguile the mind of creatures, twisting their perception of you. You can cast the spell Charm Person once with this trait. At 7th level, you can cast the spell Charm Monster with this trait instead. You regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
