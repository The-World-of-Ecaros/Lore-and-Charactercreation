The **Eldar** are an ancient ever living race that have explored the outer planes. Since they do not ever expire naturally, the Eldar are extremely cautious for what purposes they commit themselves.

Characteristics
---------------

Eldar are considered immortal as they do not grow old or have any limit on their natural lifespan. They may be of any alignment. They have a Fey Ancestry and do not require any sleep, instead entering into a trance like state where they remain semiconscious for 4 hours a day. Eldar have their own spoken and written language also known as Eldar.

History
-------

Eldar are known to live on [Azengolt](/wiki/Azengolt "Azengolt") but are not solely from there. The deity [Crowley](/wiki/Crowley "Crowley") was an Eldar who committed himself to battle and was banished by the other Eldar for it. It is said that [Elves](/wiki/Elf "Elf") are descended from the Eldar.

[Depthar Infection](/wiki/Depthar "Depthar")
--------------------------------------------

Since Eldar are immortal and the Depthar grow more powerful with the age of their host, the infection of an Eldar is extremely dangerous. No natural Eldar have been turned to Depthar since the initial stages of the infections because they are now executed whenever they come into danger of being infected. The Eldar know and accept this as necessary to protect the living. Azengoltians dislike doing this because every purged Eldar loses a wealth of knowledge and wisdom, but they recognize it as their solemn and holy duty.


As a Playable Race
------------------

The race is not unlocked for others to pick as of yet. The only way to become a Eldar currently would be a race change due to some event.

### Trance

Eldar don't need sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance".) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human does from 8 hours of sleep. If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.
