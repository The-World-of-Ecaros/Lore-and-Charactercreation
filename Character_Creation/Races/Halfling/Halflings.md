### History

Halflings just appeared one day, some believe they are the spawn of gnomes and humans, others believed they are a magical experiment. But the truth, is that in a time of great peril, humanity was threatened in the first planar war, hunted by the Slaad and pushed nearly to extinction. It was then, in a final stand at the Gate of Gil, that human blood spilled into the meadow of Hasta. What the humans believed to be just a simple, beautiful meadow was in fact, the remnants of one of the Eldar stars. Thus a small being was formed in a rapid succession, a being whom could fight against the Slaad fear that stole the humans courage. They rose up naked and screaming to fight against these beings and the day was won. Mistake for children, the halflings were taken in by humankind and such the new race was born.
