You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You canâ€™t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  **Fey Creature.** Sprites are creatures with the fey subtype.  **Laughing Mad.** You are immune to the _Confusion_ spell and forms of madness that are not fey in origin.  **Petite Stature.** You cannot wield two-handed or heavy weapons, you cannot wear medium or heavy armor, and you cannot carry other creatures when you fly unless otherwise stated from your choice of wings.  **Wing Selection.** A sprite's wings can determine not only its physical aspects but also the focus of its fey blessings.

* **Strong Wing.** Your wings are long and feathered much like those of a bird. You can carry one creature of medium size or smaller so long as you have the lifting capacity to do so. Additionally, you have advantage on checks and saving throws made to resist effects that would cause you to fall or fail at flying.

    **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. Sylvan is a majestic language native to the planar lands of the feywild, filled with song-like words that roll gently off the tongue as if magic was imbibed in every syllable.
