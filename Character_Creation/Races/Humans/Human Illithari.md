### History

The Illithari are humans stolen from dragonkind early in their creation, their biomass was useful not only as a food source, but its malleability also made them potent psionic batteries for the Illithids in the underworld. It was the civil war of the grand minds below that allowed the first of these Illithari to escape their mental prisons and as such flee to the all corners of the underworld eventually founding a secret sanctum in the light of a great crystal. It is here they hid themselves away and locked away their psionic strength in the hopes that they will not be discovered. There were some illithids that saw the horror of what they had done, one in particular was found by one of the Illithari and was nursed back to health, even when the creature lost its memory the human gave him a name. Solomon Hancock. Eventually the memories of this being returned and with it the horror as to what he had done. It was then that Mr. H, raised up an army of humans and like-minded Illithids and fought for the freedom of all. He failed and the people he tried to save were returned to their mental prisons and Mr. H was banished to the surface, so that he might live with his failure.  The Spirit of Freedom however, is not easily quelled. The witches took in this strange creature and in exchange for their care, he provided protection, until the day he could return to the underworld and free all those people from the great minds and take his place as a scion of his people and lead them out of their perpetual darkness. In the 6th era, not long ago, Mr. H got his chance, with a collection of Aekrath's bravest heroes, he ventured into the darkness below and with their aid, tore the mental shackles of his people asunder and forever was the underworld changed and branch of the human tree was returned to the surface and the glorious face of the sun.

#### Shatter

 Shatter represents the stress on the characters soul to manifest phenomena. Contrary to common belief psionics is not a strange use of the mind but instead a burning of the soul. Whenever a character's Shatter becomes 0, they fall unconscious as their soul is literally shattered. They must make a special set of death saving throws that cannot be interfered with, nor can any healing stop them. Should the character fail these death saving throws and die, they instead are raised as a husk. A horrible and dangerous monster that seeks to drain the souls of those around it.  A character has an amount of Shatter equal to Attunement Slots + Proficiency Bonus  You regain your proficiency bonus in Shatter whenever you complete a long rest.
