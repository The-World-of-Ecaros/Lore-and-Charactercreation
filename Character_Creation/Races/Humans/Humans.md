Humans
======

The humans are a very strange sort who were originally created not in the traditional manner that most races are, but rather created by the dragons. The intent of this creation was twofold. First, for the humans to be able to breed and multiply; and second, to be used as a sort of fodder force, one that would mitigate the constant struggle against the elves and other older races. During this time, the humans slowly began to develop their own various cultures as they were held captive in many different places where the dragons lived. They began to start their own nations, but it was not until Cassius rising above with the help of Runethares did mankind finally move. But now humanity was faced with a very strange problem – they'd have to find their own place in a world not used to them. Humans could be of any walk of life, of any disposition and believe a whole matter of different believes. A human is just as likely to be your friend as they are just as likely to be your enemy and sometimes even both. Although they possess short life spans, they are able to accomplish so much that many other races hide a thin jealously of how they spend their lives.
