Dragonborn
==========

The dragonborn are the dragonkind's last attempt to save themselves from fading from the world. Forged out of a modified recipe of creation that once formed the humans, the dragonborn represent the final vestige of the dragonstorm and indeed they are the legacy of one of the oldest creatures of the world. Dragonborn, like their human counterparts can choose any path they wish upon the world, but they are often times influenced by the draconic blood that flows through their veins. Dragonborn struggle in many ways with individuality and the unseen chains that hold them to the path their scales might depict.

### Culture and Cultural Heritage

Dragonborn are the inheritors of the memories of dragonkind. It is unknown the effort or ease at which they can readily access these.

### History

The first era of Dragonborn are born of the Dragonstorm. The dragonstorm is a vessel in which all of dragonkind is stored, specifically the recycled souls that make up their race, this process allows them to exist on Ecaros and not to completely vanish as they die back to where they are truly from. The dragonborn have a slight resonance as they themselves serve as living vessels for these souls and thus their memories. It is the intention that as dragons fade from the world, the dragonborn will save their souls.
