Gnomes
======

Gnomes are a curious race, they themselves were not born of the world like the other races, but rather within the veil beyond, within the realm of dreams. The first gnomes were simply dreamed up, a collection of errant thoughts that morphed from the dreamscape, when these being were first ‘born’ they themselves grew lonely and dreamed up more and more. They were all of them however, not truly alive, so Oun and Wode, gave them passage into the real world, so that they too, might truly live.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy

Gnomes are beings that exist in the world normally, but they are also possessed of dream stuff, their innate magic and whimsical lifestyles are a tribute to their origin. They are small, like halflings, possessing wild hairstyles and colors, their eyes are often different colors and their skin has even been known to change color. Gnomes are very much a product of their surroundings, as such things affect their inner dream and that in turn affects their physical body.  Rock gnomes are those that sought refuge with the Dwarfs. The Dwarfs taught them to craft and they took to it easily, their powerful imaginations and clever minds quickly pacing up to the Dwarfs and, although they will not admit it easily, surpassed them, in some areas. Rock gnomes dream of clocks, cogs and all manner of machinery. They dream of practical things to make life easier and in times of war, harder for their enemies.  Forest gnomes are those that sought refuge among nature when they first came into the world. Following the ways of the druids of old, the forest gnomes were able to establish themselves in the dreaming veil of the animals and plants of the world. They dream of beautiful things, a colorful meadow, a babbling brook and warm breeze. It was in these dreams that the forest gnomes developed the ability to talk to animals as well.  Svirfneblin are gnomes that took to the badlands and entered only misery, nearly hunted down in these terrible lands to extinction, it was then that Wode sought to guide them and taught them the wisdom in the dark, the power of fear and the lord of nightmares gained his chosen people. Svirfneblin today can be found anywhere, living their lives, unafraid of the dark. Mostly nocturnal, these being sleep during the day and walk the night, which they view as sacred. Most Svirfneblin worship Wode, although an extremely rare few seek other gods.

### Genetics and Reproduction

Although they procreate as normal humanoids, it is believed that each gnome soul is crafted by the dreams of their parents and as such, each gnome possesses a ‘mother’ dream which is often associated with their own personality, this in turn changes as they experience life.

### Ecology and Habitats

Forests, Underground, the badlands.

### Dietary Needs and Habits

Omnivorous

### Biological Cycle

Gnomes themselves are technically immortal, they cannot die of old age, nor do they even truly age, a gnome, as it lives, experiences more and more, but so to does it’s dream grow more and more enticing. A gnome leaves this world and returns to the spirit realm whenever it has nothing new to experience, whether by circumstance, isolation or a very long life. This means that a gnome can actually die from loneliness or imprisonment.

### History

Long ago, in a time of great need, when the magic of the world was threatened and war was to consume all of Aekrath, it was the gnomes who pleaded with Oun and Wode, begging them to help the waking realm. Arcane magic had all but diminished due to the many wars of the past, as such, Aekrath was ill equipped to deal with the invasions of the planar wars. So Wode and Oun made a deal with the gnomes, they would allow the dream of magic be made real into the waking realm, they would help this dream come true, but it would come with a price. So it was then, a large majority of gnomes, re-entered the dream, ending their lives, but dreaming of a world where magic has returned. As such the arcane pillar was restored and magic made whole. 3 eras hence, the gnomish population has only recovered to about half of what it was, but the Martyr’s Dream remains intact, a pity that this gift has all but been wasted as once more the arcane pillar is in jeopardy.
