Grippli
=======

Gripplis are small humanoids typically resembling tree frogs, and have slight but very agile frames. They stand just over two feet in height, but possess remarkable agility and the ability to climb or swim rapidly. Gripplis are normally brightly coloured like the tropical tree frog they resemble, though their bright colour fades as they age. They typically weigh just over thirty pounds.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy

Grippli like most humanoids are bipedal, possessing two legs, and two arms.

### Genetics and Reproduction

Gripplis reproduce via egg laying, and a newly hatched grippli takes less than a year to mature to adult size. Unless they meet a violent end, which considering the dangerous environments they inhabit is very possible, gripplis can live to reach 60 years of age.
