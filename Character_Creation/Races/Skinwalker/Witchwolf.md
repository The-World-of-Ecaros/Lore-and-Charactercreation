### Subraces

Not all Witchwolves exhibit their skinwalker nature the same way. Choose a subrace from the following. 

#### Wolf

There has never been a more successful pack hunter than the wolf: majestic, tireless, and savage.  **Ability Score Increase -** Your Strength score increases by 1, and your Constitution score increases by 1.  **Tireless -** You gain proficiency in Athletics.  **Subdue Prey -** If you move 20 feet straight towards a target and then grapple the target successfully immediately afterwards, both you and the target become prone (the target is still grappled).  **Frenzied Howl -** A snarling, ferocious howl erupts from you as an action. All hostile creatures within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw against DC 12 + proficiency or be frightened of you for 1 minute. They can repeat this save at the end of each of their turns. After using this ability, your movement speed is increased by 10 feet for the next minute. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. 

#### Hound

After thousands of years of the hound’s evolution, its loss of primal strength did not come without its own benefits.  **Ability Score Increase -** Your Wisdom score increases by 2.  **Attentive-** You gain proficiency in Perception.  **Dogged Pursuit -** Your Scent range increases by 60 feet. You have advantage on Perception or Survival checks that rely on Scent.  **Hunter’s Howl -** As an action, you let loose a low and keening howl. For the next minute, your Scent range increases by 30 feet, allowing you to know the exact location of every creature at less than their maximum hit points within this Scent radius. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
