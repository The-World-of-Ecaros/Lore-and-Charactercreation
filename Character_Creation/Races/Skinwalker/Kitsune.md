### Subraces 

#### Vulpin

**Ability Score Racial Traits -** A Vulpin increases their Dexterity score by 1.  **Trickster -** You are a natural at getting into places you shouldn’t be. On your turn, you can move through any space at least 3 inches in diameter and do so without squeezing. When you stop moving, the regular squeezing rules apply if you are in a space one size smaller than you. You cannot willingly stop in a space smaller than that, and if forced to do so, you immediately flow to the nearest space you can fit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all uses upon finishing a short or long rest. This ability also grants advantage to escaping manacles (Dexterity check).  **Go for the Throat -** You are an expert in attacking when people don’t expect it and bite where it most hurts. Once per attack action, when you make a melee weapon attack with advantage and hit, you can deal 1d4 piercing damage to a target within 5 ft. of you that you can see. You do not need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy is not incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. 

#### Seishin

**Ability Score Racial Traits -** A Seishin increases their Charisma score by 1.  **Will-o-wisp -** As a bonus action, you can call forth a mote of light to follow you, one for each tail you have. These motes occupy the same space as you and emit 20 ft. dim light. As an action, you can combine all motes together to make a target you can see within 30 ft. of you. This target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. Upon failure, the target takes 1d6 + your Charisma modifier of Radiant damage, and half as much on a successful one. Multiple motes do not increase damage. You must re-summon the motes after having made an attack with them. If you have multiple attacks within an attack action, this replaces one of them.  **Clandestine -** You are able to hide the fact that you are a Kitsune and Skinwalker, and instead appear Human. As an action, you can magically hide your ears, fur, and tail(s), and visually replace them with human equivalents. You may drop the illusion as a free action.

Kitsune are skinwalkers varying in appearance from a vulpine form to that of your average human with tails and fox ears. Naturally intuitive, number, and often charismatic, Kitsune have a deep connection to the magic that allows them to shift forms, to strike with cunning, to enchant the weak-willed, and to condense radiant magicks to sear their enemies and light their path. Long-living and proud to show it, most tend to sprout multiple tails as they get older. In their culture, it is often assumed the more tails you have, the wiser and more experienced you are. Many Kitsune that naturally appear human-like may use illusionary magic to hide their ‘extra’ features to fit in better among other cultures. The Kitsune who are more vulpine tend to embrace their nature and even the stereotypes against their kind.
