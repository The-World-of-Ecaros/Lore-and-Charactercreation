### Subraces

#### Diseased One

**Ability Score Racial Traits –** A Diseased One increases their Wisdom score by 1.  **Plague Doctor -** You have proficiency with Poisoner’s Kit.  **Enfeebling Bite -** Your bite is a natural weapon you can use to make unarmed strikes. Your bite counts as a finesse weapon, and as such, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier.  
When you hit with your bite, you can have the enemy make a Constitution save against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency + your Wisdom modifier or they deal only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the start of your next turn. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency and you regain all uses when you finish a short or long rest.

You can choose one skill for your allies or choose a skill for each ally separately (maximum of 5 allies). For the next hour, your chosen allies can reroll one d20 for the chosen skill check. The new roll must be used. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
