Skinwalker
==========

There are many races that call themselves Skinwalkers. These races are all bound by a single event: the curse of Gazenaroc. Save for the lizardfolk, nearly every being that is a mix of man and animal is a skinwalker. The skinwalkers vary as much as their human counterparts. While some have successfully integrated themselves into the world, others live in secluded colonies, hidden from persecution. Although the modern day skinwalkers are not cursed by Gazenaroc, they are born of the same ancestors that were. For long ago, some of humanity did not respect nature. They slaughtered its animals, plundered its forests, and reaped its fields, causing Gazenaroc to become enraged. Inca tried to plead on the humans behalf, saying that they were young and that time would teach them. Gazenaroc conceded and allowed Inca to try to convince them. However, as Inca summoned a contingent of dryads to speak to the humans, they were defiled and destroyed by the lawless bandits with no respect to nature. As the humans celebrated, Inca wept. Gazenaroc, pushed to the brink by his friend’s tears, cursed them all. They would learn to respect nature by becoming a part of it again. And so, the first skinwalkers were born.

Basic Information
-----------------

### Anatomy

A Skinwalker is any creature that is not mentioned elsewhere that is a crossbreed of a human and an animal. Many kinds exist, some known and some hidden in this world. Such creatures include, but are not limited to; Aarakocra, Tabaxi, Tortles, Kenku, and all manners of lycanthropy.

### Biological Traits

An Aarakocra is type skin of skinwalker that split off and sought isolation within the highest points of the world. The aloofness of elves is matched only by that of the aarakocra. They believe themselves to be above the problems of the ground. As such, many aarakocra only adventure in times of great need, great sorrow, or exile. Within their own history, there were some that fell from the skies to roam the ground. In response, the spirits that they worshipped sought to punish the traitors, turning them into kenku.  The Kenku are skinwalkers that branched off even further from the aarakocra by taking to the ground. In response, the vengeful spirits of the wind transformed them by stealing their voices and by taking their flight. This led them to wander and to adapt in a new way: by borrowing the voices from all around them. They formed a kind of chameleon society, blending in nearly seamlessly with the other civilizations of the world. The kenku themselves survived mostly by trade of both material goods and overheard secrets.  Tabaxi are skinwalkers that, in the early times, sought to trade with the other races. Led by their curiosity, charisma, and natural luck, the tabaxi found a place in the world among the other races. Tabaxi tend to take things in stride and live mostly carefree lives. Those that seek adventure do so mostly out of boredom. This whimsical nature, however, makes them prone to addiction.  The Tortles, much like the lizardfolk, sought the swamps of Dolten for their refuge where they began a slow-moving yet long-lasting culture. Tortles are traditional much to the same caliber of the Dwarfs and tend to change very little. Those that seek adventure normally do so for redemption. The Tortles’ traditions are long as are their memories, and crimes are never forgotten.

### Genetics and Reproduction

Lycanthropy is contracted when bitten, scratched, or otherwise dealt damage by the natural appendage of a lycanthrope. This contraction can only occur when the individual is in a primal state and the curse is strongest. This is why a tabaxi, for example, does not pass the curse to another when they deal damage with their claws. Sometimes, although it is rare, the progeny of a skinwalker can be born as a true lycanthrope. This normally happens whenever a skinwalker crossbreeds with a non-skinwalker.

### Ecology and Habitats

Skinwalkers can be found in any place that humans can be found, although this is mostly only for those that are an established race. Those that cannot control the beast can be found in isolated colonies within Dolten.
