**Age.** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. 
**Alignment.**Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.   **Size.** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.  
**Superior Darkvision** Accustomed to the depths of the Underdark, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  
**Keen Senses.** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.  
**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.  
**Trance.** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.  _If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed._  
**Drow Weapon Training** You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.  
**Sunlight Sensitivity** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.  
**Drow Magic** You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the faerie fire spell once per day; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day; you must finish a long rest in order to cast the spell again using this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.  
**Emperorâ€™s Gift.** You gain a +2 to your initiative rolls.  

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write [Common](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/common-article) and [Elven](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/elven-article). Elven is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elven ballads to their repertoires.
