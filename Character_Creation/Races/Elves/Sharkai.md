_**Prerequisite: In order to begin play as a Sharkai, you must be a member of the Mage's Guild, the Watch Wall, OR the Great Coven. You must also take the Shar'kai origin.**_  **Age –** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. This is also true of the Sharkai, although they are not considered adults until they pass Fi'is Sithrean.  **Alignment –** The Sharkai favor law and the spirituality it grants. They see the other elves as foolish in this regard.  **Darkvision –** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.  **Keen Senses –** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.  **Not Yet –** You have advantage on death saving throws.  **Trance –** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.  **Languages –** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sharkai.  **Sharkai Weapon Training –** You have proficiency in three two-handed weapons of your choice.  **Glory of Aladine –** When you defeat a creature, you are healed for a total amount of hit points equal to your character level + your Constitution modifier. Once this ability is triggered, it cannot be triggered again until you complete a short or long rest.  **Unbroken –** You ignore the first level of exhaustion you would take. You must complete a long rest before you can use this ability again.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sharkai.
