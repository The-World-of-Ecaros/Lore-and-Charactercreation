The Forked Tongue
=================

Once many years ago, there were four assassin guilds; these guilds were in and of themselves, rivals to the highest degree. They competed for contracts, for style, and reputation. When The Great Reckoning came, they were hired to face the threat and of the four of them only a whisper of one yet remains. Now, in the ashes of the past, The Forked Tongue returns and with it—the ancient art of assassination is revitalized.

#### Faction Loyalty Milestones Achieved

[Show spoiler](#spoiler-80hHuV)

* **15,** Downtime \- The faction itself gains downtime days as if it were a player, if 3 were awarded to the player base, the faction gets 3. These can only be used to progress agendas. These days will be submitted after each update stream.
* **27**, Gold Income \- The faction earns 1000 gold every update stream. This gold is immediately stored in the Faction Bank.
* **30,** Forward Base 1 \- The Faction begins to expand. You gain an outpost within the country that your Faction resides, Dolten for the World Wanderers. This outpost increases the magical item storage capabilities of your faction bank by 1. This outpost is not an RPable location, and can be destroyed through certain events.
* **41**, Armory \- The faction opens its own armory, in which adventuring gear, proficiency tools, and non-magical and exotic simple and martial weapons, armors, and mount/pet barding can be purchased using downtime days, faction members buy these at 50% discount, players from other factions and factionless buy them at full price and 50% is directed to the faction coffers. When you RP the purchase with the Quartermaster of a faction with this milestone, you do not need to spend a downtime day on shopping. If you do not, you must spend a downtime day to do so.
In both cases you will need to submit a trading log in the trading-log chat below is an example.
