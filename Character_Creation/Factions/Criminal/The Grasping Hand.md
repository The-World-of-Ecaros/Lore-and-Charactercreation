General
-------

 **Attribute Cap Increase** \- +2 Wisdom; this Boosts the Maximum of an ability score but not the score itself.  **Tool Proficiencies** \- Alchemist Supplies, Land Vehicle (Jail Wagon)  **The Black Hat** \- Much like the once fear inducing inquisitors of old, these black hats provide not only a mark of membership but a few useful enchantments as well. While wearing this hat a character has advantage on Insight checks, Investigation checks, and Perception checks, but only when used specifically to track a mark officially contracted by The Grasping Hand. (DM Discretion)  A member of The Grasping Hand is marked by the trademarked black hat, but there are many styles in which to choose from. This contains not only the symbol of The Grasping Hand, but also the name of the member—in case they should perish on duty.  **The Stone of Deception** \- Members of The Grasping Hand may reroll a failed Deception check once per long rest.  **Poisoner's Gloves** (Janus Hilden - Captured)  This pair of black gloves is equipped with a hidden compartment for storing a dose of poison. This can be applied in the following ways:

* Contact poison that can be applied on a handshake, hive five, or similar function of mutual contact.
* Injury poison that can be applied through an unarmed strike or melee weapon.
* Internal poison that can be applied by sprinkling the poison through the glove into food or drink.

Applying this poison uses a bonus action and the poison's use can be concealed if the wearer makes a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check as part of this bonus action. Another creature must beat this check to detect the use of the glove. This does not mean they know what the glove was used for, only that material was used within the glove.  Upgrades The Sleight of Hand Check is made at advantage if the wielder is wearing the black hat.

* Inhaled poison, as a 15ft cone pocket sand attack. This requires a successful Sleight of Hand check DC of 15 to do properly. All creatures in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid this poison. The DC is equal to the normal save DC of the poison. If they fail they must roll against the poison as normal.

  **Caustic Ooze** (Mordraz Darhul - Captured)  This potent poison can be applied through injury. It causes 4d6 Poison damage and causes an enemies movement speeds to become 0 for 1 round. It is a DC 18 Constitution save to avoid the movement reduction and reduce the damage by half. At the beginning of each mission, a Grasping Hand member has enough for 1 dose. This poison cannot be traded or hoarded.   **The Dark Jack** (Felgrum Volkhaz - Captured)  A member of the Grasping Hand is granted The Dark Jack when they join the faction and gain proficiency with it.  The Dark Jack is an exotic weapon and therefore require other means to gain proficiency, such as [Academies](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/academies-article), should it be wielded by a non Grasping Hand member. This includes if you leave the faction, as you also lose proficiency that way.  Special ability: This blackjack grants advantage on attack rolls on the first round of combat and if it deals sneak attack damage on the first round, the victim must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.  **Roguish Training**  
The following loyalty benefits unlock when you react the requisite loyalty  Loyalty 3: Your time spent in the company of rogues and kidnappers has taught you much of their hidden language and mannerisms. You learn Thieves' Cant.  
Loyalty 5: The time and effort you have put into the Hand is noticeable while you wear the hat in your confidence and stride. You gain advantage on Intimidation and Persuasion checks to convince a mark to come quietly and without a fuss, and to convince guards to let you pass without incident.  
Loyalty 7: You’ve continued your training with the Hand, and more experienced kidnappers have taught you—either by example or force—ways to use a more slender figure or the capability of hiding one’s feints to physically restrain targets. You can use Sleight of Hand or Deception to grapple a creature or to escape a grapple. If you possess the Grappler Feat, marks have disadvantage when attempting to escape your grapples.  
Loyalty 9: Your roguish teachers have imparted a bit of their experience on you in the time that you have spent in their midst. Choose a skill that you are proficient inm when you do you gain Expertise in that skill.  
Loyalty 11: You have reached the epitome of your roguish training, and your teachers in the Hand have nothing else they can impart on you. You gain access to the Sneak Attack feature, but only gain a single Sneak Attack Die. This die follows the same rules as regular Sneak Attack. If you already possess the Sneak Attack class feature, instead you can reroll a number of Sneak Attack dice equal to your proficiency bonus twice per long rest. If you choose to do so, you must take the new result.

### Tenets

* We are not assassins, accidents happen—and sometimes a dog needs to be put down—but don't kill your mark oncethey are captured.
* Conduct yourself with professionalism, we don't like slobs.
* Only go after contracted targets; if you absolutely must deal with something personal, take your hat off, you're doing it on your own time.
* If the local authority or some other faction tries to stop you from turning in your bounty, let them go if you must; then take down everyone's name, compile a report, and the bosses will take care of it.

 \-\-\- 

> **Cathedral of Sin Award: Library of Kaceal**  Members gain access to the Library of Kaceal for use with the research system.

 \-\-\- 

> **Grasping Hand Poisons**  These special poisons are available only to members of the Grasping Hand. At the beginning of each mission, a Grasping Hand member has enough for 1 dose of each with the exception of Last Nerve. These poisons cannot be traded or hoarded.  **Tear Drop**  
> (Inhaled)  
> This clear liquid holds a toxic gas that spreads poisonous fumes throughout the body affecting sight and vocals. The eyes become covered by a dark grey haze, burning the insides, as small, hot tears roll down the target's face, and their throat clogged to the point where they can barely breathe let alone speak at all.  A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be silenced and blinded for 1 minute.  **Last Nerve**  
> (Injury/contact)  
> A simple searing concoction, upon touching the skin, burrows itself into muscle and bone. Stopping and locking up the body, subtly, and painlessly. Those that resist this poison will find it fights back by giving their nerves a small jolt.  A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of the creature’s turns, it can make another Constitution saving throw. When the creature is no longer paralyzed it takes Xd4 poison damage, X being the amount of saving throws failed, minimum of 1d4, maximum 5d4. This damage can be avoided entirely if the creature has lesser restoration cast on it or some other similar effect targeting the poisoned condition.  Three doses of this poison can be brought on each mission.  **Dust of Dread**  
> (Ingested)  
> A mix of many different and experimental poisons ground carefully into a dust, easily dissolved in spices and drink. Even enhancing the taste to the most mediocre of dishes to make sure they take it all in, before it slowly, unknowingly infects both the body and mind into a fatigued and depressing state.  A creature that ingests this poison suffers no Effect until 1 minute passes. If the poison has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on all saving throws for 1 minute. Should the saving throw result be a 5 or lower, the creature falls unconscious for 10 minutes. Another creature can use their action to attempt to shake the unconscious creature awake, letting them reroll their saving throw. Any instance of damage on the creature also triggers a reroll. On a successful save, the creature awakens and has disadvantage on all saving throws until the start of it’s next turn.
