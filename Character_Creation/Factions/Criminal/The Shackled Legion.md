The Shackled Legion
===================

![](img/The_Shackled_Legion.webp)

 "There are some that face The Iron and are broken by it, and then there are others who face The Iron and wield it."  These words are written above The Iron, the great prison found in the Krazaxian mountains. This prison is somewhat strange as it is composed of those all around the world that have been sent to be looked after by Krazax for a simple purpose. To earn their freedom, they must prove themselves in battle—and with each victory against the enemies of Krazax they may remove a portion of their sentence. Despite this opportunity, many do not live through their first battle. Those that do become one of The Shackled Legion, seek redemption through conflict.  No one is innocent in The Shackled Legion, everyone has committed a crime; the degree of said crime usually results in the fervor in which they fight, as many become desperate with just a little hope. All are treated equally regardless of their crimes, save for that some starting benefits differ depending on the crime. Oftentimes, even after their sentence is served many stay on in order to train new recruits and help them survive or attempt to build a strange camaraderie of sorts.

### Loyalty Benefits

**

#### Marks of Service

 Marks of service are tattoos given to prisoners and guardsmen alike, these tatoos which mark their loyalty and even special accomplishments. These have an array of special effects but have a prerequisite of loyalty and some special effects.  **The Iron Brand**  Prerequisite – Loyalty 1  Gain 5 additional hit points  \-\-\-  **Flame Serpent Sleeve**  Prerequisite – Participated in a Dsangir event, Loyalty 1  Gain fire resistance.  \-\-\-  **The Old Hand**  Prerequisite – Loyalty 2  You gain Thieves' Cant 

* * *

#### Vavren Boons

 Blessings bestowed by the Crow-Father to assist the legionnaires on their path of redemption for both themselves and for others.  **Redeemer’s Grace**  Prerequisite – Loyalty 3  Whenever you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1. This can only happen once per long rest.  \-\-\-  **My Life, Freely Given**  Prerequisite – Loyalty 4  Whenever an ally would die within 30ft of you, you can choose to die in their place—doing so stabilizes the ally at 0 HP. If you die in this manner, it costs half as much (gold wise) to bring you back from the dead. Keep in mind that this cannot prevent Violet Death. 

* * *

### Tenets

**Prisoner Tenets**

* You are here to repent. A second occurance of the crime that gave you your sentence will result in execution, for you cannot be trusted by the legion.
* Betraying a comrade, by either malice or grave incompetence, will result in execution.
* You are not here to earn money, you are here to earn your freedom. Members of this Faction receive no mission payout reward for their participation as long as they have time on their sentence.
* Your only purpose is to redeem yourself. You gain no Downtime Days or Crafting Days. You may gain and spend these as normal when you have served your sentence.
* Death, in service to redemption, is the greatest honor. Do not be afraid to seek it, but do not be wasteful in embracing it.

 **Guard Tenets**

* Protect the prisoners from illegal harm. Guide them on their path to redemption.
* Provide service to Krazax and its allies during times of need.
* Keep the peace within The Iron and if needed, punish those prisoners out of line.
* Prevent the avoidance of redemption, whether that be through kind words or the executioners axe.

* * *

### VINPC

** **Warden Blackstone** \- The Warden of The Iron, cares for the well being and feeding of the prisoners and will hear their complaints through written requests. He normally only shows up in person if there has been a crime committed, or in the case of the death of a prisoner. 

* * *

### Ranks

 There are only two ranks in The Shackled Legion, guard and prisoner.

### Exit

** When leaving The Shackled Legion, you sacrifice all loyalty benefits. You may leave automatically once your sentence is served, but those that stay on afterwards are awarded the loyalty rewards. If they leave at a later time they still lose all access to these benefits. A character who completes their sentence may leave and join another Faction with no penalty to play.

### What does "Prison" mean?

** **_Can they receive visitors?_**  Yes, although they are monitored and are not allowed physical contact nor trading of items.  **_Can they be awarded items on missions?_**  Yes, although it is returned to the Faction's Bank as soon as they return and are only allowed access to them if there is sufficient relevance. They may take money but it is surrendered to Krazax when they return home, they do not get to keep it.  **_Can they trade items?_**  Mixed. Items can be traded between SL members and their Faction Bank. These trades of ownership can be permanent. They cannot receive aid directly from other sources while on a mission. But if an item is borrowed during a mission or something similar, they can use it or consume it. However, all borrowed wealth is given back when the mission is concluded.  **_What can the Ambassador do?_**  The Ambassador can leave the prison to go on diplomatic missions, although the same rules for prison apply and they are under escort. They can recruit directly to The Shackled Legion, but only for prisoner exchange; if you want the benefits of time served, you must serve time. This escort is controlled by a DM.  **_Does being in prison suck?_**  Yes. If at any point you are unsure as to whether or not you are allowed to do something, lean on the idea that you cannot until it is addressed.  **_Points that have been addressed:_**  You may have parchment to write or draw on in your cell at this time, and the creation of it may help you pass the time.

#### Additional Benefits:

> **Faction Tool Empowerment: Brewer's Supplies**  +1 Brewer's Supplies are made available to the Faction. Any Faction member can use this kit, but it cannot be removed from the Bank; additionally, it does not count toward the number of total magic items in the bank for the purpose of the magic item limit.

> **Subclass: Bladesinger**  Any wizard that is a member may take the Bladesinger Subclass regardless of race, so long as they are a member of the Legion.
