Jail Wagon
==========

Fade Steel Autowagon (Spider)  Cargo Capacity - 2,000lbs  This wagon is like a normal wagon except the top is covered, the walls are reinforced with iron and the bars on the entrance work as a rather efficient jail. It functions like a normal wagon and may contain up to 5 prisoners.  This wagon is made of fadesteel and is powered by a chromatic core, a dangerous piece of spire magic that can explode if tampered with; this also allows the driver of the contraption easy locomotion that requires 8 hours to recharge for every 24 hours of use. This vehicle does not require horses to move.  In addition the fadesteel legs of this version of the autowagon means it moves at normal speed when not on a road.  The DC to break the bars is 18  The DC to pick the locks is 18
