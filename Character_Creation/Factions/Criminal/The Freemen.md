The Freemen
===========

![](img/the_freemen.png)

 Bloodwave Bay is home to a wretched multitude of scum and villainy. Some however try to make some order of the chaos. Copper Cove, the unofficial capital of Bloodwave Bay, seeks to serve this purpose by at least attempting to combine all of the free folk of the sea into a pact of mutual protection under the name of "The Freemen". This ragtag binding simply ensures that should all be threatened, all shall respond. It is unclear how steadfast these binding words and signed papers will be. But as of yet, the words have not been tested. You joined the Freemen for whatever reason suits you, just be sure to come when you are called upon. Especially when Kaheeli is involved.

### Curse Marks

The sea possesses many secrets and only the hardest of people can handle the cost of those secrets. Once a mark is taken, it can never be removed. If The Freemen leaves the faction, they lose the benefit of the mark but retain the negative for the remainder of their lives. Should the character with this mark die, the mark is removed.  **_Kaheeli’s Kiss_**  A Freemen that takes this mark, receives only half the normal healing they would receive, but they deal an additional 4 damage on any weapon damage roll they would make.  **_The White Terror_**  A Freemen that takes this mark, gains a fearsome aura. However they are treated as if they are a fiend for the purposes of paladin smites and other effects.  
_Aura of Fear._ At the start of your first turn in a combat, you can choose to activate this aura. Creatures within 20 feet of the bearer of the mark must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the player's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. You must finish a long rest before you can use this ability again.  **_Burning Man_**  A Freemen that takes this mark gains vulnerability to fire damage and can never gain resistance or immunity to fire damage. This also negates spells that would redirect or prevent fire damage. In exchange, The Freemen increases the die size of fire damage they deal by 1 step. This includes weapon damage dice that deal fire damage.

### Shanties

When Freemen work together anything is possible and many have underestimated the spirit of the salty veterans. A shanty can only be activated with at least two Freemen present. Each additional Freemen increases the effects of such an ability. X in these abilities is represented by the number of Freemen. While performing a shanty, the participants cannot do anything else other than spend actions on the shanty, take a bonus action, or move. Once one shanty is performed, that shanty cannot be performed again until a short or long rest is completed. Freemen who are also Bards count as two in these calculations.  **_Leave Her Johnny_**  This shanty takes 1 round to complete. When it is completed all allies within 60 feet are healed by Xd10.  **_Whiskey in the Jar_**  This shanty takes 1 round to complete. When completed, all allies within 60 feet can immediately move up to 10 feet * X . This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and can cause a paralyzed or stunned ally to move.  **_The Cruel Wars_**  This shanty takes 10 minutes to perform. When completed, all allies within 60 feet gain a +2 to damage against humanoid enemies. This lasts for 10 minutes. 

### Bardic Shanties

These are special sea shanties that can only be started by bards within The Freemen, afterwards members of The Freemen and those who possess the pirate subclass may join in. Unlike other shanties, you only require 1 Freemen to start this shanty.  _**Northwest Passage**_  This shanty takes 1 round to complete. When completed,all enemies within 60 feet of a creature that sang the shanty and heard the shanty are affected by the Calm Emotions Spell for 1 minute, The DC for this shanties is equal to 12 + X.  _**The Flying Dutchman**_  This shanty takes 1 round to complete. When completed, all enemies within 60 feet of a creature that sang the shanty and heard the shanty must make a Wisdom saving throw or gain the frightened condition. The source being any creature that participated in the shanty. The DC for this saving throw is 14 + X.  While frightened by this shanty, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you via the safest available route on each of its turns—unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. After 1 minute the frightened condition ends.  _**Captain ____**_  This shanty takes 1 minute to complete. Whenever an ally that heard the shanty sung for the full duration rolls Bardic Inspiration, they add X to the result.

### Gifts of the Mountain-Born

As repayment for the generous gift of viakin longships to the Kingdom of Krazax, the Dwarfs have reinforced the forges of the bay—making them more efficient.  All magical item crafting requests made from predominantly metal, stone, or gemstones have their crafting cost reduced by 20%. If a dwarven special crafter is used, the crafting cost reduction is increased to 40%. This is considered a faction forge upgrade, and cannot be utilized with special crafters who cannot use faction forges. Only members of The Freemen can benefit from this upgrade.

### VINPC

 The Freemen have no de facto leader since the disappearance of the Pirate King, Red Eyes Raymond. Therefore, the Chapter Master can call upon the other pirate captains to meet and discuss issues, but the Chapter Master must have earned their respect and it will take quite a few deeds before they will give them the time of day.
