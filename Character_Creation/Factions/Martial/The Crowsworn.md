The Crowsworn
=============

Babylon is amongst the oldest being in Aekrath and the surrounding planes, but there are some threats that even one such as he will need assistance with. The Astral Reckoning brings with it a power not seen in an eye blink and the Lord of Oaths will not see it return unresisted. Not this time. Returning to the one creature whom he owed a debt, one that would never collect, he once more tests the meaning of this friendship, to ask without shame and to give without compensation. He seeks his friend, Vavren.

* Vavren is our ally, no harm is to come to his followers, nor his interests.
* Chaos is a disgusting infection, seek to destroy it wherever you can if it is possible.
* Seek the Dark Thrones of the Lost Hells, stolen by usurpers, only their power can prepare us for what is to come.
* The Reckoning must be stopped, even if it means to work with those we despise. As long as you are successful you are forgiven, if you are not you will be punished.

### Loyalty Benefits

#### Blessings of the Krähewyrm

**Loyalty 2 Benefit: Krähewyrm’s Plumage**  
You gain the blessing of the great dragon crow, the Krähewyrm. You may choose one of the following benefits. Once selected, the chosen benefit cannot be changed.  Cloak of the Crow: Once per combat, as a bonus action, you surround yourself with phantasmal feathers for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency modifier. When a creature makes a melee attack on you, they take piercing or slashing damage afterwards equal to your proficiency bonus. This happens if they hit OR miss.  Beguiling Grace: You gain an aura of dark allure. You gain a +2 on intimidation checks against good or chaotic creatures, and +2 on persuasion checks against lawful or evil creatures.  Bird’s Eye View: You gain 10ft devil sight. If you already have devil sight it is increased by 10ft.  Chaos Canceled: Critical strikes made against you do not deal bonus damage. You do not deal bonus damage when you land a critical strike.   **Loyalty 5 Benefit: Gift of the Dragon Crow** You have fully unlocked the power bestowed upon your people by the Krähewyrm, and can unleash it upon your foes. As you move, feathers the color of the deepest abyss sometimes get left in your wake. Your shadow appears as if you have great, feathery wings, even if you have none. You may choose one of the following benefits. Once selected, the chosen benefit cannot be changed. These abilities can be used once per long rest.  Breath of the Darkest Night: You can use your action to sprout enormous wings of darkest black and gain a fly speed of 30 feet for one minute. As an action on one of your turns while you have this fly speed, you can expel a burst of black, razor sharp feathers in either a 30 foot radius centered on you or a 50 foot cone emanating from you.. All within the area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failure, a target suffers 8d6 necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and are not blinded. Using this attack removes your fly speed, and ends the ability.  Avatar of the Setting Sun: You can use your action to sprout enormous wings of darkest black and gain a fly speed of 30 feet for one minute. On each of your turns as a bonus action while you have this fly speed, you may shoot a serrated quill from your wings at a creature within 120 feet of you. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 necrotic damage, halved on successful save. Using this attack 5 times removes your fly speed, and ends the ability.
