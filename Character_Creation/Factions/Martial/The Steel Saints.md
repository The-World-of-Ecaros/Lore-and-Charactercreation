The Steel Saints
================

![](img/The_Steel_Saints.png)

 The Steel Saints are a mercenary company formed in the aftermath of the Reckoning. Lead by some of the surviving heroes of that perilous time, the Steel Saints have created for themselves a reputation for getting the job done in the 60 years since. Recently , the company has formed a more determinable identity, featuring its own banner and uniform. Even so, a Steel Saint's individuality is encouraged, so there are many wild alterations. The Steel Saints take on any mission that doesn't have any evil purposes; this is not necessarily a moral obligation but rather a practical one. The Steel Saints have dedicated themselves to the martial arts in all their forms. They recruit those that use magic but boast and encourage their magically inclined members to pick up training in a weapon, whenever possible. Their dedication is perhaps their most defining attribute, as once a Steel Saint makes a promise, only death can stop them. 

Starter
-------

**Anointed Saint's Mail**  
+1 Chain Shirt  
_This armor is blessed by the way of the warrior and feels like a second skin; light, durable, and dependable._  This armor counts as light armor instead of medium armor and it has no maximum Dexterity cap.  \-\-\-  **Fadesteel Helm:** This helmet removes the disadvantage penalty for sneaking in heavy armor, in addition, it provides a +1 to stealth checks.  \-\-\-  **Anointed Gear**  
A Steel Saint is granted one of the following weapons to wield when they join the faction. The Steel Saints gains proficiency with the weapon. Only one of these weapons may be wielded at a time. Paired weapons are an exception, and the anointed crossbow of the Watch Wall has no bearing on this.  The following weapons are exotic weapons and therefore require other means to gain proficiency, such as [Academies](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/academies-article), should they be wielded by a non Steel Saint. This includes if you leave the faction, as you also lose proficiency with these weapons that way. 

* **Heartscale Greatsword:** This greatsword has a wider blade and a compensating hilt, giving an excellent secondary use as a shield. Although it grants no AC bonus, this weapon can be used as a shield in regards to fighting styles, feats, and other select effects.
* **Vengeful Tooth:** This war pick is longer and more brutal than it's normal counter part. This particular weapon has the versatile property and when wielded in two hands it deals 1d10 damage instead. The extra weapon damage die rolled when this weapon critically hits, is dealt as bleed damage. This damage is cumulative.
* **Scythe Wing:** This glaive is lighter in design and it's sweeping design allows for it to increased damage due to quick movements. Whenever you successfully deal damage with this weapon, you receive advantage on your next acrobatics check within 2 rounds. If you make an attack and you have succeeded on an acrobatics check this round, you deal an additional 3 damage. (You only gain this bonus if you attempt an acrobatics check with a DC of at least 14)
* **Tail Mace:** This morning star is thicker and heavier than it's normal counterpart. It gains the heavy property. Once per round, whenever you damage an enemy with this weapon, that enemy must make a DC 12 strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If this attack is a critical hit, they have disadvantage on the saving throw.
* **Twin Talons:** These shortswords are pairs and balanced to be used together. If the first attack you make in a round is a hit, you may make the off hand attack with your off hand weapon without expending a bonus action, however you may not spend your bonus action to make additional attacks the round you use this free off hand attack.
* **Spineshot Bow:** This shortbow is designed for close quarters fighting and unlike it's counterpart can be fired in melee without disadvantage.

 \-\-\-  A set of bone dice or deck of cards, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. 

General
-------

**Attribute Cap Increase:** +2 Strength; This boosts the maximum of the ability score but not the score itself.  **Tool Proficiencies:** Gaming Set of your choice, Land Vehicles.  **Silver Ribbon:** The Steel Saints mark their membership with a silver ribbon, usually tied to the arm or weapon. This is the only requirement in their uniform. 

### The Anointed Forge

_This masterfully crafted forge built by the white fire from the Lord of Blades serves as an auxiliary facility, that appears as a glorious forge._  This awe-inspiring forge can only be used by a few. You will need proficiency in and posses smith's tools. Only a crafter that possess a relevant crafting origin may operate the forge, such as the Hide Flayer, Forge Child, or Mender, but even they will have a chance to fail. Only a Forge Cleric can use the forge without failure, and they do not require a relevant origin.  All items successfully crafted with the forge will require prestige to wield, but using the forge does not. 

### Contracts

Completing Contracts as a member of the Steel Saints progresses the Steel Saint faction. 

### Thunderer

The sound of Steel Saints banging their shields before battle can be heard loud and clear.  Steel Saints gain access to the following fighting style:  You can make a bonus action melee attack using your shield with proficiency. When you do, use your Strength modifier and do 1d4+your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. When you make this attack you lose the shield’s AC until the start of your next turn. Should your shield have a flat bonus to AC (+1, +2, +3), you can add that bonus to its attack roll and damage roll.  This does not replace your current fighting style class feature. 

### Ironcross

The infantry of Daborak have long since learned to use even the greatest of weapons as a defense.  Steel Saints gain access to the following fighting style:  As a free action when you make your first attack on a turn, you can choose to use your greatsword as a defensive weapon. When you do, all attacks you make this turn are made with a -5 to hit, and you gain +3 AC until the start of your next turn, so long as you are wielding a greatsword.  This does not replace your current fighting style class feature. 

### Hammering Strikes

The Viaken’s axes rip and tear everything they touch.  Steel Saints gain access to the following fighting style:  While wielding an Axe, a successful attack that exceeds the target’s AC by 5 or more sunders the armor, temporarily reducing the target’s AC by 1. This effect can stack a number of times equal half your proficiency modifier, rounded down, and the effects of hammering strikes are lost at the start of your next turn.  This does not replace your current fighting style class feature.

### Loyalty Benefits

#### Silver Eagle's Call

 _Loyalty 3_  A Steel Saint can use an action to let out a battle cry. All player character allies that can hear you within 30 feet can make an attack roll with a weapon against an enemy within the range of that weapon up to 30 feet.
