The Hkari
=========

![](img/The_Hkari.png)

 The seals of the green pantheon hold the elements in balance so that the material plane may function. The druids seek to hold the balance in place, but their numbers and strength have greatly diminished since the Reckoning, so it is up to the Hkari to aid them. The Hkari serve not just to safeguard what remains of the druids, but their original purpose was to hold back the tides of evil pouring from the hells, the abyss, and Abbadon. Dark forces vying for a single foothold within Ecaros itself are held back only by the mighty Hkari. These veiled knights, led by the Black Phoenix, are the bane of demons, devils, and daemons. As such, their souls are the most prized by these creatures. They will sacrifice anything they can to grab a wayward Hkari soul, but they are protected by their legendary armor. Forged from the souls of the fallen Hkari, their armor serves not only as defense but as a last resort should they fall. But someone must hold back the tide, someone must stand against the darkness and put their faith in the light! 

Starter
-------

**Hkari Plate**  
Full Plate Armor (Requires Attunement)  
_This legendary armor, passed down to all members of the order, is forged and infused with secret rituals and the souls of Hkari past. However such power comes at a cost._ 

* This armor contains a +1 enhancement bonus, and increases in might as the wearer gains strength. At 5th level it becomes +2 and at 10th level, +3.
* You gain proficiency with this armor if you don't have it.
* This armor also provides a +3 to any hit point gained form any source of healing.
* If you should ever die, to protect it from the evil constantly waiting for it, the armor seals your soul within to keep it safe and to power the next Hkari. A Hkari can never be resurrected.
* The armor can be taken off, but no matter where it is, your soul returns to it once you have attuned to it, which you do when you join the Hkari.

 **Fadesteel Gorget:** Whenever you would be subject to a critical hit, you reduce the damage taken by 5.  A set of traveler's clothes, Smith's Tools, and a pouch containing 10gp.  **Improved Starting Equipment:** Choose three from the following item sets to start with: x2 bandoliers, potions of healing x 3, pole of collapsing, antitoxin, empty vials x 2, bullseye lantern, smokestick, net, hourglass. 

General
-------

* Any who join after level one receives the Hkari Plate and must attune to it.
* **Attribute Cap Increase:** +2 Wisdom; This boosts the maximum of an ability score, but not the score itself.
* **Tool Proficiencies:** Smith's Tools
* **Magic Item Crafting Bonus:** Crafting magical items at the Hkari's faction forge increases crafting speed by 25%.
* **Blazing Glory: You gain this upon entering the faction and if you leave and somehow survive you lose it.** In True Combat (combat against a threatening foe), when you roll a 20 on an attack roll, you gain a stack of Blazing Glory. For each stack of Blazing Glory that you have, you deal an additional 5 damage of the weapon or spell's original type against hostile creatures. Additionally, you score a critical hit on a 19 or a 20 when attacking an outsider, which is further increased by 1 if you have the Improved Critical or Superior Critical features as appropriate, and you gain a stack of Blazing Glory if you score a critical hit in this way. All stacks of Blazing Glory fade when True Combat ends.
* **Knowledge is Power**: You learn the language Wicked
