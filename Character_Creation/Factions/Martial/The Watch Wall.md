### Hail from Hardened Steel

_The Watch Wall members are trained to use crossbows without sacrificing their defense._  Members of The Watch Wall gain access to a fighting style with the following benefits:  You ignore the loading property.  While wearing a shield, you can wield and load any crossbow with a single hand.  Additionally, when you deal damage with an attack using a crossbow against a creature within 15 feet of you, that creature must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice), or be pushed back 10 feet away from you in a straight line.  This is an additional benefit to Watch Wall members and does not replace the fighting style class feature. This fighting style is lost upon leaving the faction.
