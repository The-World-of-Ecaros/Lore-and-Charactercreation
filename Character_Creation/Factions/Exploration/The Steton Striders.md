Starter
-------

 Pick either the Feller's Blade or the Hunting bow.  **_FadeSteel Feller's Blade_** \- +1 Greatsword - This heavily worn out greatsword is a pass down tradition among the Striders. To wield one of these weapons is to walk the path left behind by hunters before! This weapon deals 2 additional damage to any creature that is one or more size categories larger than the wielder.  **_Fadesteel Hunting Bow_** \- +1 Longbow - A pristine longbow strengthened with fadesteel. It has not yet been tested, but traditions have to start somewhere. This weapon deals 2 additional damage to any creature that is one or more size categories larger than the wielder.  A Staff, a Hunting Trap, a trophy from an animal you have killed or that has been passed down to you, a set of Traveler's Clothes, Brewer's Supplies, an Instrument of your choice, and a Belt Pouch containing 10gp  **Improved Starting Equipment** \- Choose three from the following item sets to start with: x2 Bandoliers, x3 Potion of Healing, Pole of Collapsing, Antitoxin, 2 Empty Vials, Bullseye Lantern, Smokestick, Net, Hourglass.  _**Feller's Armory**_  The Steton Strider's gain one of the following Staring Equipment, with which they are considered proficient.  _Feller’s Hook_

* Grappling Hook (Ranged Weapon)
* Damage: N/A
* Special, Thrown (Range 120), Two-Handed, Finesse
* Special: While you hold the rope attached to the hook in at least one hand; a huge or smaller creature with a fly speed hit by this grappling hook cannot move outside of the range of this grappling hook with their fly speed unless they deal 5 points of slashing damage to it (AC 14) or succeed on a Strength check to break free as an action, DC determined by 8 + Your Proficiency Bonus + Your Strength Modifier. As a bonus action you can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against the creature, on a success you pull the creature down to an unoccupied space at least 30 feet away from you, on a failure their position does not change.

 _Huntsman’s Horn_

* Warhorn
* This warhorn can be blown as an action, signaling that a hunt has begun! It rings out, able to be heard up to 150 feet away and all allied creatures within 50 feet of the user gain a +2 to their initiative. Once they do, they cannot benefit from this benefit again until they finish a short or long rest.
* This Warhorn can be used as an instrument, and also functions as a Club.

 _Bulette Slayer’s Staff_

* Quarterstaff
* As an action you can plant this quarterstaff into the ground. When you do it begins to vibrate rapidly, sending out sound waves. All creatures with tremorsense do not benefit from it while within 45 feet of the quarterstaff. If the quarterstaff leaves the ground this effect ends. It can be removed with an action.
* This weapon deals an additional +2 damage to creatures with Tremorsense.

 _Huntmaster’s Trap_

* Hunting Trap
* When you use your action or bonus action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on the pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 Piercing damage and stop moving. At the beginning of each subsequent turn, until a successful DC 15 Medicine check is made or they are healed in any way, they take an additional 1d4 bleed damage as the trap had cut into their limb. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 2 piercing damage to the trapped creature.
* When a creature breaks out of this trap, it resets itself to the closed position. A creature can spend 1 minute to disengage the Hunting Trap for later use.

General

Membership into The Steton Striders is marked by the swagger in your gait, the smile on your face, and the scars on your body. But lacking all that, a tattoo with their symbol on an often visible area of skin. The overall design is up to you and, indeed, many Striders develop nicknames and stories around their tattoos—adding them as they grow more seasoned.  **Hunting Trophy**  If you choose one of the trophies in the table below, it can be used as a special type of crafting material. You can read the rules at [Magical Item Crafting Rules](/w/Ecaros-xohoo/a/magical-item-crafting-rules-article) for more information on crafting.

### Loyalty Benefits

 **Loyalty 2**  _Walk the Halls_  The heroes of the past do not forget their friends, members of this faction are granted the ability to return to life. Whenever a character with this boon would die, there is a 15% chance that they immediately return to life. If they are returned to life in this way they come back with half of their hit points and with no afflictions. Some enemies may have abilities to bypass this. Once this occurs it can never occur again. This does not prevent death from old age. 

* * *

### Tenets

* Do not disrespect the beasts you hunt.
* Those that shed their blood with you are your brothers and sisters, do not abandon your family.
* Courage is your calling, but just because death is a glorious notion for you does not mean it is for you companions; consider their feelings before your own.
* Stealth is important to the hunt, but when you strike your enemy is aware of you. You will see its determination and meet it with your own! HAHAHAHA!
