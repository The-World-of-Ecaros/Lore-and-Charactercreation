#### _Power of the Eldunari (Feats)_

 _Awakening Feats_  These feats are made available whenever the appropriate Eldunari is awoken. Should all the Eldunari be awakened, Crovux’s awakening feat becomes available. The feats have an additional prerequisite that you must have the blessing of the appropriate Eldunari. If you gain vulnerability and immunity to the same element through these feats, the effects cancel out one another and the rules are as normal. These feats are available to loyalty 2.  
 
 **Fone - The Absolute Cold** 

* You gain immunity to cold damage
* You gain vulnerability to fire damage
* You gain a 30ft cone Cold damage breath weapon, this scales like the dragonborn racial breath weapon, except, it deals its damage in d10s. It can be used once per short or long rest. If you are a dragonborn, this feat replaces your old breath weapon and you gain an additional use that recharges in the same manner. If you take this feat, you cannot take other dragon born feats or benefit from them. Your subtype changes to Eldunari regardless of race.
* First of the Fells blessing has its cold damage increase from a +2 to a +6. This applies to the breath weapon.

### Tenets

* Morality is for lesser beings, do not bother yourself with it. Do what you believe, nothing else matters.
* The strong eat the weak, mercy is an injustice. Spare no one and expect no one to spare you.
* The Dragons of Dragonstar are our sworn enemies, eat them like the prey they are.
* Find my children and bring them back to me, or I will find someone else who can.
* The World Wanderers are a useful instrument, we do not break useful things.
* The Astral Reckoning threatens the world, _MY WORLD._ See that it is stopped, even if you must deal with the weak to do so.

* * *

### VINPC

 Eldos Daikura - One of the last surviving Eldunari and son of Crovux.

### Exit

 On leaving the Eldunari Lords you sacrifice all loyalty benefits and your Eldunari Blessing. You may have your tattoo removed if you wish, but it must be done by another; The Eldunari Lords will not remove the Mark of Crovux.
