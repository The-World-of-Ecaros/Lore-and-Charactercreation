Ranger Stones
=============

To Travel in Aekrath is a dangerous proposition, not only against bandits but of all the terrible creatures that lurk in the dark, hungry beasts that prowl the camp and the unpredictability of nature. The Ranger Stones are a circle of rune stones connect by an anointed rope. This circle of stones comes in many sizes, but most World Wanderers carry with them a traveling set that can protect a camp of nor more than 6 individuals.  Ranger Stones provide the following benefits to a resting party within their protection:

* Wandering creatures have disadvantage on perception and investigation checks to find the campsite or detect the party within.

* Provides the temperature benefits of the Guiding Stone to all those resting within.

* Any healing that occurs from spending hit dice during a rest, heals that creature an additional 4 hitpoints.

 (DM Clarification)  A wandering monster is any creature that does not already know your party is there,it does not grant disadvantage against any creatures actively hunting you. This protects you from random encounters.  For the Ranger Stones to grant their benefits they cannot be moving and must be fully splayed out in their full circle. If there is not enough room for the circle of stones to be splayed out the Ranger Stones have no effect. The diameter of the circle of traveling Ranger Stones is adjustable, a minimum of 3 feet to a maximum of 40 feet.  A "campsite" is just the location in which the party rests.  The Ranger Stones cannot be used as a weapon.
