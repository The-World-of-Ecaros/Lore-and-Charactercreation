The World Wanderers
===================

![](img/The_World_Wanderers.png)

  The World Wanderers is one of the oldest factions in Ecaros, founded in the first age as a focal point for human migration. It quickly became a faction dedicated to the way of the ranger — to tame the wilds and protect the great roads that allow travel to go smoothly. Bound between nature and industry, it is the ranger's duty to see that progress and conservation meet in a balance. It is their mission to guide the lost, defend the wilds, punish the brigand, and be the first line of defense against imbalance. The World Wanderers are not a particularly religious faction, as they must separate themselves from zealotry to keep a balanced mind with nature and progress. But they hold a deep respect for the druids, with whom they work very closely. The World Wanderers boast many members, even non-rangers as in the wilds any tool is welcome over an empty hand.

### Tenets

* Serve nature and the progression of humanoid kind. Find the balance between the two and make your judgments wisely.

* Protect the traveler.

* Never be wasteful in any aspect of your life, for to do so is to walk a slippery slope into complacency.
