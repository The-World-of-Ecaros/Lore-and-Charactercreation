Factionless
===========

There are those whose path is not defined by the politics and structure of an organization, but by their own decisions, achievements, and struggles. This is the path of a Factionless, one who does not align themselves to any formal faction in particular. 

Starter
-------

 Starting as Factionless at 1st level grants 1 Tool and 1 Skill proficiency of your choice. You cannot choose a class critical tool, such as thieves' tools for rogues unless, you are of that class. If a character later becomes Factionless, this bonus is not granted. 

General Rules
-------------

 A player who is Factionless may, at any point, decide to join one of the factions of Ecaros. When doing so, the character retains their bonuses from starting Factionless, but doesn't not gain any Starter equipment unless they are the target of that faction's Ambassador's Reach or pay the Faction Buy in cost of 400 gp upon joining. The character does however gain the General bonuses.  For example: a Factionless character who joined The Freemen would gain the attribute cap increase and tool proficiencies, but not the Starter equipment. However if they spent the gold on the Faction Buy in or joined after being the target of the Ambassador's Reach ability, they would gain the starter benefits.  A Player who is within a faction can choose to become Factionless or join any other faction at any time. However doing so imparts a 2 week out of game penalty of being unable to participate in any Ecaros sessions, decreased to 1 week and spending that week as a Factionless if the target of an Ambassador's Reach. During this time the player may still role play in any text based RP channels they have access to.  All Factionless players receive an additional downtime and crafting day per week, provided that such days were awarded (you cannot gain crafting or downtime days for that week if none are given), and they retain these extra days even if they join a faction during the week they were Factionless.
