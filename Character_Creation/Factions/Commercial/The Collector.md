The Collector
=============

![](img/the_collector.png)

 There is a man, elusive and enigmatic, that lives within a private estate inside the holy city of Crestfall. His collection of rare and mysterious artifacts are legendary to the few allowed to see them. How does he come to acquire such things, this hermit? That is where you come in, an opportunist, tempted by the promise of extraordinary wealth. You set out to serve this individual, to be his hands and eyes, to fill his endless greed and boundless curiosity. He pays quite a bit for your loyalty and discretion.

#### I Vote Money

 The Collector has a tendency to spend money on problems, thus causing a lot of doors to be opened. As such through these purchases, upgrades can be given to other factions in exchange for a small piece of their power. Such upgrades from these factions are always available to the Collector except if the factions are at war.  **_Taltaken Trinkets_**  The Collector has purchased the right to use the Taltaken gear—normally only available to the Mages Guild—as such the Chapter Master—once per update stream—can choose a piece of Taltaken gear available to the Mages Guild. Doing so causes that gear piece to become available to the Collector. Whenever this choice changes, the items in play are replaced with the new ones; because you are not barbarians and you keep your end of the deal.

* As a result of the actions of The Mages Guild, The Collector permanently gains access to this ability, without having to use "I Vote Money" on The Mages Guild.

#### Viaken Fighting Styles:

The Collectors gain access to the following fighting styles: _

#### Offensive Option:

_**Hammering Strikes:** While wielding an Axe, a successful attack that exceeds the target’s AC by 5 or more sunders the armor, temporarily reducing the target’s AC by 1. This effect can stack a number of times equal half your proficiency modifier, rounded down, and the effects of hammering strikes are lost at the start of your next turn. _

#### Defensive Option:

_**Shield Deflection:** When you are wielding a shield with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to double your shield's AC bonus for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. If this does cause the attack to miss, you have advantage on your next attack against the source of the attack.  Example: You have a +2 shield and 17 Ac with it equipped. As a reaction, you add th 4 AC again, temporarily bringing your AC to 21 Should that cause the attack to miss, you gain advantage on your next attack against that target. This only functions for 1 attack, and the bonus goes away after.  This does not replace your current fighting style class feature.
