  History has many faces, many facets like that of a brilliant gemstone. The shining light within is that of truth, but truth is not always so clear, as bias often times clouts it. The Bards of the world, seek to preserve this truth in it's purest form, so that all may benefit from the lessons of past. The Bards College accepts applicants with something to offer to the world, for they themselves are not only dedicated to preserving history, but adding a bit of flair to it as well. Songs, plays, music, and revelry are powerful tools to spread a message. The Bards have mastered this practice and are welcomed by most civilized lands to preform their great recordings. You have joined the bards, whether it be to become a bard yourself, to protect them as they go on their travels, or to seek their knowledge, you have agreed to aid them. What will the bards record of your adventures?

### Facilities

 _The Observer's Chambers_  The hidden chambers beneath the Bards College has revealed many secrets or knowledge and ancient lore. The recovery of the Observer's Chambers has not only recovered several pieces of the Elves' history, but as well as the great magic contained within. This facility possesses the ability to observe other worlds and in an inexplicable way, reap magical essence from such places. Doing so could contain knowledge and power of unknown importance. Along with the recovery of the chambers, a codex was also recovered. This Codex seems to speak of a particular section of the sky, a Rentoss Nebula.  The Bards College will have the ability to target one of the following celestial bodies and have the chamber study it, receiving knowledge and a boon. However the power of the chambers is so taxing that it can only change its direction once a phase. The Chapter Master decides where the observatory is pointed. Descriptors, key words, and additional information will be made available as time goes on and, depending on events, missions and additional codexi.  **_Rentoss Nebula_**  _Ragdar_  The Lifeless World  _Astaranos_  The Endless Ocean  _Band_  The Outcasts  _Erast <= This is the current focus_  The Archons  **Focus Bonus**  **_Improved Spellcasting Matrix_** \- Due to the arcane knowledge etched from the world of Erast, all Bards College members have their spell DCs increased by 1.
