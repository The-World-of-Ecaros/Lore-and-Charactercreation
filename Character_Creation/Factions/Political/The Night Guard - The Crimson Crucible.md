The Crimson Crucible
====================

The Crimson Crucible is an intense trial that will test the body, spirit, and mind of an aspirant for the Night Guard. It should be noted that you can only attempt this trial once per player, per phase. Choose wisely if you are prepared for such a test. This test is only able to be taken at Character Creation, at Prestige 3, or through the use of the Night Guard Ambassador's Ambassador's Reach ability.  The character must succeed on the following saving throws, which exist outside of normal play and therefore are made only with base character abilities. No spells or outside influences shall be counted. you must succeed on **ALL** of the following saving throws to quality to be a Night Guard, if you fail then you get the Wash Out effect, listed below.

* Test of the Body - You must succeed on a DC 12 Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw.

* Test of the Mind - You must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw.

* Test of the Spirit - You must succeed on a DC 12 Character level Check (d20+character level). If you have the Night Guard Aspirant Sub-Origin, you gain a +2 to this roll.

 If the character is a follower of the Goddess Iass, they may reroll a failed save for this trial once. They are allowed only a single reroll.  **Wash Out**  
For those that fail the Crimson Crucible they walk away broken and scarred. Their bodies and minds are never really the same. Choose a single ability score. That ability score is reduced by 1, after character creation. The player may choose why this reduction is in place, how they failed, and what scarring or malediction manifests, if any. The player may also choose to have their character die in the trial and create a new one. This does not cause them to lose their place in the current character wave.
