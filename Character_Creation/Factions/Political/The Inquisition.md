The Inquisition
===============

![](img/The_Inquisition.png)

  The Inquisition was created in the early days of Orde, to root out elven spies and quickly began to specialize in detecting will and intent. Many times in Ecaros's history it has been implemented in times of great need, although not without equal controversy. The third inquisition was perhaps the worst, as it not only caused open war between two countries, but indeed the greatest loss of life in a single battle in the entirety of Ecaros's history. So many died that day, that the ground on which Gravewatch sits and the Crimson Citadel overlooks was forever changed, becoming a misshapen landscape of undeath. Since the conclusion of that war the Inquisition fell greatly out of favor with the Council of Light, and indeed much of the war. It is only now, in the 6th Era, that a great need to find that which is hidden once more has arisen, not in any small part of the actions of a priest named Zachariah, reinventing the Inquisition and changing the course of Orde in the process. Its tenets remain archaic, but with hope, Zachariah will be able to change them to what they need to be.  Recently the Inquisition has undergone several internal changes, now no longer a temporary institution but rather something else. Now completely autonomous of the White Council, it is free to protect Orde as it sees fit, only falling under the White Council on matters of international importance or diplomacy. Many know not what to expect from a changed Inquisition, only time will speak to its motives and efficiency.

### Loyalty Perks

#### Boons of the White Pantheon

 **_Fury of the Light_**  Once per mission or act of a campaign, a member of the Inquisition may call upon the light to empower their next attack. This must be decided to be used at the start of the turn in which you wish to use it. It empowers the next attack, that if it hits, is considered a critical hit. If the attack misses, the effect is wasted. if this is used against a target without the evil alignment the effect is wasted. This may only be used on an effect with an attack roll. 

#### Loyalty 2

You must choose Service to the White Pantheon if you are a paladin, cleric, or gregorian rogue.  **_Service to the White Pantheon (Paladin, Cleric, Gregorian):_** Gain a 2nd Lip Service and Church Boon from a deity that is in the White Pantheon.  **_Glory:_** You have advantage on Perception, Investigation and Survival checks to seek out evil creatures or Cult activity. Once per short rest, If you hit a creature with an attack you may convert all damage done to a creature to radiant damage. If the attack was made with a greatsword, then add 2d6 to the damage roll.  **_Viderick:_** You gain advantage on charisma checks against evil creatures. Once per short rest, As a bonus action you can restore hit points to a creature within 5 ft equal to your charisma modifier plus your level.  **_Vavren:_** You gain advantage on saving throws against the charmed and frightened condition from evil creatures. Once per short rest when you or a creature within 10ft takes damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total.   **_Runetheras:_** Skill checks you make to learn about an evil creature or cults have advantage. Once per short rest, whenever you make an Arcana, History, Nature, Martial or Religion skill check you may add +5 to the result.
