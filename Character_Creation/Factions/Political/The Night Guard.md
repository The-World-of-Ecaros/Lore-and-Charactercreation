===============

[![](/uploads/images/2e9eef80f676238697fdc83a0dd91ca4.png "nightguard.png")](/i/284947 "nightguard.png")

 The dark forests of Dolten and it's denizens are held back by two things. The Ranger stones made by the rangers and the Night Guard. The Night Guard are both the military are of the country as well as it's wardens against the vile forest. Every member of the Night Guard is considered an elite warrior in their own right, even from Dolten's rival Daborak. This is due to their deadly vetting process, in which applicants must undergo intense physical, mental, and spiritual training. Their bodies are tested in the breaking. An obstacle course that they must complete in a ludicrous time. Their minds are tested as captured or contracted evils attempt to drive them mad in dark rooms beneath the Crimson Citadel. Their spirits are tested, as the witches of Dolten pull their souls form their bodies to test them against a myriad of hexes. Only those that can pass all such trials can hope to be a Night Guard.  The Night Guard was founded by the first Witch Queen of Dolten, in the hopes that the common people could survive the terrible dangers within the Abhorrent Arboreal. Since openly used witchcraft caused such diplomatic strife with other countries the witches went into the shadows while publicly the Night Guard became the protectors of the people from the terrors of the night.

This armor does not provide disadvantage on stealth checks, it is also infused with the eldritch power of the witches and allows the wearer to gain advantage on saving throws against compulsion, fear, and curse effects.  A silver pendant, a hunting trap, a vial of holy water, tuft of wolfsbane, cold iron charm, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 30gp  The Night Guard are Recognized mostly by their iconic red armor, but they also are all branded on their right hand with a powerful warding hex. This acts as protection against the darkness, but also as a sign of all they accomplished.  \-\-\-  The Shadowfell is a dark place, but the Night Guard are no stranger to such places. As recompense for their assistance, the Empress of the Shadowfell has arranged a few additional armaments and supplies to assist the Night Guard in their future trials. These items function only for the Night Guard and cannot be traded or loaned.  _**Silencing Bow** \-_ This magical longbow is used by the royal guard of the Empress of the Shadowfell, they have been loaned to the Night Guard to assist their endeavors and only to recruits that have proven themselves worthy.

These shadow arrows cannot be fired or exist in hallowed light.
