The Iitanas Imperium
====================

![](img/The_Iitanas_Imperium.png)

 The emperors of the past ruled much of the world, they varied as much as any leader, but each was fair handed and all the races were happy, if not equal beneath their guidance. When Emperor Twelvestar was betrayed by his son, the family line was cut asunder and with his final words the emperor cursed his son, this curse manifested itself as the dark elves, who still wander the world, lost and without a home as much as the other elves.  Now some elves have taken it upon themselves to bring about the old ways and give their people the home that they seek once more. The Spires have been convinced and though they face challenges from the conformists and the Shar'kai, Daeadar Azzakeen, the imperial vizier hopes to build a proper place for the new emperor to rule, whose identity to this point has been kept secret.  The empire now calls out to all those that seek the old ways. Whether you seek to reclaim the elven homeland, seek to find a home for them, or are in it for the untold benefits of having helped them, you may join the Imperium and together rebuild the future.

**Imperial Robes:** These robes are a near weightless Light Armor, granting 13 AC + Dexterity for armor class. However this item requires no proficiency to use, but can only be worn by members of good standing in the Iitanas Imperium. If the robes are attempted to be worn by anyone else, the robes immolate themselves and are destroyed.  **Imperial Dance:** The Imperial style of swordplay was developed specifically to handle fighting groups of angry peasants. This fighting style is general suited to dealing with large groups of enemies. While wielding at least one 1 handed weapon in one hand, and no shield, you receive a +1 bonus to AC and a +1 bonus to weapon damage for each additional enemy that is within 5 feet of you beyond the first, to a maximum of +3.  **Fadesteel Ring (Elven):** This ring provides a +3 to maximum hit points. If you are a full elf, it provides +5 instead.  **Aladine's Glory:** Users of this fighting style deal +1 additional damage with melee weapons for each creature that has been killed in the current combat encounter. This must be a legitimate enemy that is threatening to the character (level check).  Painter's Supplies and 50 gp stipend.
