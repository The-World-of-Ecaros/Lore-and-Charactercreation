The Last Grove
==============

The druids of Aekrath have known great hardship, not only suffering losses during the Great Reckoning, but even losing their homeland and scattered to the winds. However, the seed of life is not easily extinguished, within a single seed a grove can be regrown and it was one such seed that grew into The Last Grove. Lanzu Lutfi, a gnome of humble origins, planted the seed and watched over it as it grew, his actions resonated with the abandoned circles and with the efforts of all druids. As such a final sanctum of druid kind was forged and its fate now lies in the hands of those within.

General
-------

 **Mantel of Seasons** \- A crown made of leaves, that shift with the seasons is worn in the open, signifying the responsibility and commitment to druidism. This mantle allows non-druids to find their way to the Last Grove, but are not available for trade and theft results in stealing only leaves.  **Attribute Cap Increase** \- +2 Wisdom; This boosts the maximum of the ability, but not the score itself  **Tool Proficiences** \- Herbalism Kit  **Language** \- Members of this faction learn Druidic and can speak it without judgement for as long as they remain members, leaving the faction means they lose it unless they gain it from another source (Such as being a druid)  **Important** \- The Last Grove is dependent on the number of druids in the world and also those that wear the mantle. If ever there is not enough druids or members of this faction it will cease to be, and with it the tradition of druids. This calculation began at the start of Phase 3.

#### Faction Loyalty Milestones Achieved

[Show spoiler](#spoiler-aVNFod)

* **15,** Downtime \- The faction itself gains downtime days as if it were a player, if 3 were awarded to the player base, the faction gets 3. These can only be used to progress agendas. These days will be submitted after each update stream.
* **27**, Gold Income \- The faction earns 1000 gold every update stream. This gold is immediately stored in the Faction Bank.

When you RP the purchase with the Quartermaster of a faction with this milestone, you do not need to spend a downtime day on shopping. If you do not, you must spend a downtime day to do so.
In both cases you will need to submit a trading log in the trading-log chat below is an example.
