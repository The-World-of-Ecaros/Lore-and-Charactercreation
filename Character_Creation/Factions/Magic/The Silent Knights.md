The Silent Knights
==================

Image Pending  The Silent Knights originated as a small group of adventurers, serving the brothers Oun and Wode. Through trial and tribulation they gained power and purpose, culminating in the direct aid of the Gods they serve. Thus they cemented their place as their protectors, and the mortal protectors of the Great Dream. Stand strong before that which would endanger the Dream, for you few stand as its first, and final, line of defense against all that seek to claim it.
