The Great Coven
===============

![](img/The_Great_Coven.png)

 Dolten is a dark place with many dangers, but there are far greater dangers than those in the dark forest. They lurk just out of touch of the mortal realm, patrons of great power and seductive words. The witches of Dolten formed a pact with Baba Yaga, founding the Great Coven to act as a slave against the darkness and instead turn it into Dolten's gain. The witches of Dolten have since sought out those whose souls burn brightly enough to handle the dark tasks of unseen lords. You have joined the Coven, not because you wanted to, but because you were chosen. The why is unclear, but what you must do is not. You will serve the witches in whatever scheme they may need doing, for each step you take is a controlled one - one that keeps the unknown at bay. 

Starter
-------

 A cauldron, Alchemist Supplies, Cook's Utensils, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15gp  **Improved Starting Equipment** \- Choose three from the following item sets to start with: x2 Bandoliers, x3 Potions of Healing, Pole of Collapsing, Antitoxin, 2 empty vials, Bullseye Lantern, Smoke Stick, Net, Hourglass.  **A Dark Gift** \- You gain the Eldritch Sight invocation and may use it normally.

General
-------

 **Attribute Cap Increase** \- +2 Constitution; This boosts the maximum of an ability score but not the score itself.  **Patron Blessings** \- Unique feat only available for those of the Great Coven. This blessing can be used to replace an old feat if you have one, you may only benefit from a blessing if you have an ASI in which to place it. This can only replace an old feat. This does not replace another use of ASI. This is otherwise a general benefit.  **Tool Proficiencies** \- Alchemist's Supplies, Cook's Utensils  **Barbed Brass Ring** \- Membership within the Great Coven is marked by those that wear a barbed brass ring. Mundane to the sight but significant to the ordained.

### Loyalty Benefits

_

#### Patron Blessings (Feats)

_ **Blessing of the Shadowhound**  Requires 1 Loyalty to the Great Coven.  The Shadowhound is a great canine, it's contorted shade-like form causing it's feature to be confusing at times, but it's purpose is not. It is a witch guard of the highest caliber, as it guards the Witch Queen herself. The Shadowhound gives it's blessing to those that would be the wall that stands before the many threats.

* Once during a short rest you may choose an ally with the spellcasting class feature. If you do whenever you are adjacent to that ally, you take half the damage they would take in an instance of damage. You can take this damage 3 times per short rest.

* * *

### Tenets

* Do as you're told; question, but obey.
* We are not a well-kept secret; use discretion, reveal yourself only when needed.
* Safeguard those you travel with from things they do not understand. The eldritch forces are most deceptive.
* Above all else, destroy any evidence of Oloken'hai; kill his minions, silence his whispers.

* * *

### VINPC

 **Volas, Illithari Warrior**  Volas was one of the heroes of the rebellion and although in his older age, is still a capable warrior and an even more capable psionic. He stands watch over the Great Coven in Mr. H's stead.  **Ryliona Torose, Gith Cleric of the Red Star**  _Strange Occurrences_: Once per mission whenever you would roll a Natural 1 on a d20 you can instead treat it as a Natural 20.
