===============

[![](/uploads/images/30fb03231a50b42349692e0454a32df0.png "mageguild.png")](/i/284944 "mageguild.png")

 The once proud Mages Guild remains but a shell of its former self. Nearly destroyed during the Reckoning, it has survived due to the heroic efforts of the Archmage Los, who has seen the guild through the rapid shifts in power. At one time the Mages Guild ruled over much of magic; controlling magical travel, magic item creation, and guarding the world against the terrible secrets the arcane hides. However, after being shattered by war and rebellion, the Mages Guild can barely maintain power in Majital, let alone the world. However, the future of the Mages Guild is brighter due to the resurgence of new magic from distant lands. The hunger for knowledge rekindled and unbound by the bygone bureaucracy.

This also will allow for Taltaken to be constructed in the future, which will be a special agenda to do so.  **Current members gain access to these items.**  You can choose up to two of these items to gain as a part of your starting equipment.

* Taltaken Flamestaff - This weapon functions as a quarterstaff, however if the spell green-flame blade is cast through it, you can effect a third creature with the effect that would normally affect the second creature with the spell. All normal rules still apply and it must be a separate creature from the first two targets.
* Taltaken Vambrace - While wearing this item, whenever you would hard cast shield, your AC from the spell is increase by 6 instead of by 5 for the duration.

* Taltaken Greaves - While wearing this item, whenever you would hard cast Misty Step, you can teleport up to 100 feet instead of 30.

The above items do not require attunement, but you can only wear one Taltaken item on a character at a time. Taltaken Gear can be traded freely between members of the Mages Guild. However that gear cannot be traded to people outside the faction, as it is returned to the Guild when leaving the Faction. It cannot be turned into the Guild in exchange for another piece of Taltaken Gear. 

General
-------

 **Attribute Cap Increase** \- +2 Intelligence; This boosts the maximum of an ability score, but not the score itself.  **Tool Proficiencies** \- 1 Artisan's Tool of your choice.  **Guild Band** \- Ring - This magic ring not only stands as a mark of your membership in the guild, but it is a power magic item in its own right. Guild Bands are simple platinum bands with a single gem decoration. The gem type and cut is whatever the individual wishes, yet within the gem burns the symbol for the Mages Guild. This ring provides the character wearing it access to a cantrip form the Wizard spell list of their choice. Once it is chose it cannot be changed. The character can cast this cantrip as long as they wear the ring, even if they themselves are not casters. This cantrip uses your Intelligence modifier.

### Special Actions

If stuck in a logical Fallacy the creature will cease to function, save to protect itself and return to the guild. Should this creature be capture it will destroy itself as a triggered action, upon realization of its situation. DM discretion decides when such a thing will occur. The secrets of the Taltaken must be protected at all costs.  You can only sanction a mission once a month with a Taltaken, but that creature stays until the mission is finished or one of the above parameters are met.
