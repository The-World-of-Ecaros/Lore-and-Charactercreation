### Loyalty Benefits

 At Loyalty 2, the Song of Sorrow creates within you a seed of madness, a primal, visceral reaction to the overwhelming sadness. Choose from one of the following boons to determine how the seed blooms within you. 

#### Fear of Creeping Death

_It’s coming. It’s coming. It’s coming. It’s coming. I’m dead. I’m dead. I’m dead. I’m dead._  

* **Boon:** While moving away from a hostile creature, attacks of opportunity from them against yourself are made at disadvantage, and while frightened your walking speed increases by 30 feet and cannot be reduced to 0 as part of that same effect.
* **Bane:** You have disadvantage on saving throws to resist being frightened.

#### Soulwrent

_Life. How exciting._  

* **Boon:** You have advantage on saving throws against abilities that would inhibit your movement or ability to act, a list of applicable conditions is as follows: charmed, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned, and unconscious if you were to be knocked unconscious not as a result of being reduced to 0 hit points. If you would already have advantage on this saving throw from a source that is not this ability, you gain +2 to the saving throw.
* **Bane:** You have a permanent -2 penalty to initiative checks and automatically lose initiative ties.

#### Visions of Flesh

_Why does everyone believe that this could be immoral? Such beauty-- how could something wrong produce something so perfect and good? The way the blood fountains, the diminuendo of screams...incredible._  

* **Boon:** All spells or abilities you cast/use gain a +1 to the DC of their saving throws. This cannot benefit item DC’s.
* **Bane:** You cannot become proficient in the medicine skill, and if you are already so you lose it while you possess this ability (remember that expertise is a multiplier).

#### Pierce the Veil

_Today, I think I truly saw it. No more whispers and shadows in the periphery of my senses. All it took was expanding my mind, just a crack, for precious, precious knowledge to slither in and make itself at home._  

* **Boon:** Whenever a creature is slain in combat, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus. At midnight each day, roll 2d6, and choose one of them after determining their results. If you roll the same number on each die, then you gain the one rolled as well as one of your choice. You gain the benefits listed below corresponding to what was rolled:
    * 1: Once per day you may replace a death saving throw with an automatic stabilization.
    * 2-5: You may cast Detect Evil and Good, Detect Magic, or Detect Poison and Disease once per day. Once you cast a spell with this ability you may not do so again until you finish a long rest.
    * 6: You may gain proficiency in a skill of your choice that you are not already proficient in. This proficiency is lost at the start of the next day
* **Bane:** Any healing you receive from a creature other than yourself is reduced by 1 per die to a minimum of 1 (total).

 

* * *

### Tenets

* Seek the truth beyond the veil, lies are sweet, the truth is not.
* Lawful being are agents of our destruction, do not trust them and seek to destroy them if possible.
* Secrecy is paramount, the light searches to blind us.
* Seek the Shards of Calamity, such a weapon must be used to stop that which is coming.
* The Reckoning must be stopped, even if it means to work with those we despise. As long as you are successful you are forgive, if you are not, you will be punished.

* * *

### VINPC

 **The Tome of Lot** \- An ancient tome of mysterious origins, residing within the Hakumen. Contact might be possible, if such a thing is capable of communication. 

* * *

### Ranks

#### Faction Loyalty Milestones Achieved

[Show spoiler](#spoiler-IOuR2f)

* **15,** Downtime \- The faction itself gains downtime days as if it were a player, if 3 were awarded to the player base, the faction gets 3. These can only be used to progress agendas. These days will be submitted after each update stream.
* **27**, Gold Income \- The faction earns 1000 gold every update stream. This gold is immediately stored in the Faction Bank.
* **30,** Forward Base 1 \- The Faction begins to expand. You gain an outpost within the country that your Faction resides, Dolten for the World Wanderers. This outpost increases the magical item storage capabilities of your faction bank by 1. This outpost is not an RPable location, and can be destroyed through certain events.
* **41**, Armory \- The faction opens its own armory, in which adventuring gear, proficiency tools, and non-magical and exotic simple and martial weapons, armors, and mount/pet barding can be purchased using downtime days, faction members buy these at 50% discount, players from other factions and factionless buy them at full price and 50% is directed to the faction coffers. When you RP the purchase with the Quartermaster of a faction with this milestone, you do not need to spend a downtime day on shopping. If you do not, you must spend a downtime day to do so.
In both cases you will need to submit a trading log in the trading-log chat below is an example.

> (at) Trading (at) Yourdiscordname Spending “Total Gold spent” at the (Faction name) Armory  Items bought and at what prices  (at)QM

  Then the QM simply Confirms by also putting in how much gold will be added to their Faction bank. 

* **49**, Forward Base 2 \- The Faction continues its expansion. You gain another outpost within the country that your Faction resides. This outpost increases the magical item storage capabilities of your faction bank by an additional 2. This outpost is not an RPable location, and can be destroyed through certain events.
* **50**, Research Improvement \- The Faction intensifies its researching capabilities. While the Faction has active research it will submit research days as if it were a player. These days cannot complete research.
