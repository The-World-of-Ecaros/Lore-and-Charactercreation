### The Tilted

Tilt (Ez Clap) The halflings call their patron deity Tilt, a warrior, a friend and reincarnation, all in one. Tilt is a being that promotes friendship and loyalty, especially to those bonds formed in battle or other forms of bloodshed. Rebirth is something that is not quite understood among those that follow his faith. Tilt from time to time he appears into the world with no memory of whom he is and without most of his deitic power. He wanders in this state, promoting the same ideals he would as a deity, he does this until he is slain, most likely while protecting a friend. It is the common belief that these reincarnations occur due to Tilts loyalty, seeking the friend he failed, denied redemption and even memories of that which he lost.
