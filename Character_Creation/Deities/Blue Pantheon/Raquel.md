### Timekeepers

Raquel (Ra-kell) Tick Tock, time is a precious and irrecoverable currency. There was a time some 70 years hence when this was not believed to be true. Raquel is one of the recently ascended deities, tasked with the unreasonably difficult responsibility of repairing time ravaged by the Great Reckoning. As a patron deity of the gnomes, newly freed from her exile into The Great Dream, she juggles her responsibility to her people, and as the deity of sacrifice and time all at once. She watches forward in time to an unseen horror constantly tallying her clock, fearing that history might repeat itself.
