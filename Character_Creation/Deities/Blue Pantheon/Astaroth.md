Astaroth
========

### Rothians

Astaroth (Ass-Star-roth) The Dwarfs of old speak of the underworld, a place of caverns that have their own sky, that have even their own sun. This dark sun, is believed to be the throne in which sits the maker of the Dwarfs. Astaroth, is a being that upholds strength, conviction and the earth. He believes the weak should die and the strong should live. Only fools believe otherwise. Although the Dwarfs of Ecaros have left behind his open worship in the favor of more amenable deities. Depictions of Astaroth can be found in the deepest places of Krazax and there is rumored to be a great deep gate, that bars the way to the underworld. Where Astaroth waits to rise again to punish his children.
