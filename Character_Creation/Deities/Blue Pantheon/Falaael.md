### Elderan

Falaael(Fall-A-ale) When the world was young and wild things wandered the land, it is said that a single star fell from the heavens and from it's grace, the first of the elves walked Aekrath. This elf named himself Falaael and it was rumored created the first five families with stardust. Elves then preceded to rule over the continent for a span of 1,000 years, bringing in a glorious age of the elven empire, which through the ebb and flow of time, eventually fell, now the elves are little more than nomads, with no true home on Aekrath, they wander lost and thier celestial lord weeps. Alas, Falaael, once ascended cannot directly aid his people and instead uses his position to lead his followers towards a path of sovereignty and starlight. He also serves as a bane to those who have slighted him and his followers.
