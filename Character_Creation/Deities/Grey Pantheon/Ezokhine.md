Ezokhine
========

### Ezonite

Ezokhine (Ez-O-Kine) In the first era, when the Feywild opened and spilled its life into the world, the first life was that of the primordial beasts and errant forces. One such piece of life fell within a simple stone, the stone gained life, it could think, it could feel but it could not move. So there it sat, watching a wild valley shift through the annals of time. In this time it saw the first races appear, it was picked up, thrown, carven into a point, killed and finally was left within a river. There as the blood from the creature it killed was washed away, the stone found its voice. It spoke the rivers name, it spoke the name of the sky and finally it spoke it's own name. From there the stone, rebelled against it's shattered form, it wept that it could not control its own fate. However, fortune is fickle and it was picked up by a new race of the land. There it sat in a cave, a token of affection, but it observed many things, it watched the creatures create not just each other but create shelter from the rain, clothing for their backs and finally, the power of fire. The stone lamented its form, it wished it could be something else, until finally it was. Thus Ezokhine was truly born and has dedicated himself to watching over all that would remake their world.
