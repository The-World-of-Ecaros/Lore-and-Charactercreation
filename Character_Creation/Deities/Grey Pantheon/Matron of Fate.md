Matron of Fate
==============

### Fated

Matron of Fate (EZ Clap) Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, but there is much more to it than that. Each action taken or performed, ripples through the tapestry of fate, the Matron watches these ripples and produces prophecies based on the current threads. It is not that a prophecy can be false, but rather that a prophecy can change, no mortal is bound completely by fate, nor are they completely unraveled from it. For each can twist and color themselves, but they are all of them apart of the Tapestry.
