### Ouninites

Oun (Own) Dreams are a powerful force, they flow through all sentient creatures and serve as source of inward reflection and truth. Sometimes they can look outward, discovering the truth of things in the world and even the future. Oun is the caretaker of this powerful force, a being with a wispy form and strange words. He is a patient, caring yet aloof deity.
