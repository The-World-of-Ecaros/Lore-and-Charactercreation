Kaheeli
=======

### Kaheelans

Kaheeli (Ka-Hee-lee) The goddess of chaos, disaster and the sea. A wild force of freedom and the divine fairness of chaos. Many cry out to her for mercy, some for power, but the ones that cry out most of all, are sailor's, for the seas are unpredictable dangerous and free. Those brave few call out their prayers to her, while sailing along her domain regardless of her permission. To this Kaheeli offers respect, but the challenge of the sea. Those proven wanting are stolen away to the abyss to an unknown fate.
