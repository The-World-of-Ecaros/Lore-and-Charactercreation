Nero
====

### Nerite

Nero is in his essence, the duality of altruism and greed. For what is altruism? Does one do good deeds because they are good? Does it not benefit them as well? Are such things self serving? This question encompasses the source of Nero's power and is reflected in his symbol. The Coin, with two faces.
