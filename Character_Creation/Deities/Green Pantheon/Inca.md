### Incans

Inca (EenKa) Inca, the Spirit Tree, has long served as a symbol of longevity, enduring the ages through war, strife and storms. It even survived being stolen from the world before it was returned by a group of unknown adventurers. Inca serves as a guide for all plant life, a spiritual conduit for these creatures to find themselves recycled, so that they might find renewed purpose. Inca is seen as a god of few words, mainly communicating through the flowers on it's branches. It is benevolent, nurturing and steadfast, in it's preservation of all vegetation. It serves the seasons, changing it's children to suit them, in turn the seasons provide balance for all.
