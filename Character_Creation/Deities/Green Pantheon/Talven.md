### Talvenites

Talven (Tal-vin) Winter is a harsh time, when most work ceases and people struggle to survive. Talven is a harsh, wise and stoic god. He sees winter as a time for reflection from a years experience. To those who squander it, he pays with blizzard and wolf. To those that appreciate it, he lends his wisdom, so that the next year might be easier. Talven has a soft spot for children however, he has conjured many games they might play and songs they might sing. It is even rumored, that for those truly unfortunate, Talven dons his red cloak and leaves them presents to find, wherever they may be. Talven, like his colleagues, serves nature first, no matter how unpleasant the task may be.
