Gwaina
======

### Gwainans

Gwaina (Gwaa-na.) Gwaina is the goddess of spring and one of the aspects of nature. She embodies new beginnings, birth and seeds. As one of the old faith, she is often times seen as strange by the younger gods, more so in her fickle nature, as not all beginnings start well. However, despite her otherworldly aspect, she is seen as a kind and free spirited goddess and along with her colleagues balance the seasons and nature itself.
