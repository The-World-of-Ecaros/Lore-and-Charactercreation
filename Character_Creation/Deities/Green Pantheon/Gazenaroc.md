### Gazers

Gazenaroc (GazeInARock) A creature of inumerable forms, the god of animals Gazenaroc, is a wild, loyal, yet merciless deity. He seeks to constantly evolve, to change, to overcome. He protects all of the animals in the world, he has no disdain for human kind, but finds most of them untrustworthy. The shapeless one can appear as any creature at any time. This makes following him a fairly trying ordeal, but he rewards loyalty and commitment with the boon of the animal kingdom. He serves alongside Inca, in order to keep balance, by constantly evolving and shifting the weights of the world.
