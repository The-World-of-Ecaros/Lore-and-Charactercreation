### Sillowans

Silloway (Seeloway) Summer is a time for work. Silloway carries a similar attitude. She is tough, loud and hardworking. Her kindness is felt by the diligent and her wrath, the lazy. She, along with her colleagues of the old faith, serve to balance nature and persevere through time. Often seen as harsh by some of the younger gods, such things are pointless to Silloway. An honest day's work is it's own reward after all.
