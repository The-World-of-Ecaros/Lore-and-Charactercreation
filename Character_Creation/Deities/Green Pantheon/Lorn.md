Lorn

### Lornans

Lorn. In nature, even death creates life. Creatures swarm in the night, rot creates room in which life may be born anew. Lorn holds sway over these forces, he serves as their warden and wielder alike. Lorn leads the other deities of nature, for it is through him that they may all continue the cycle. Lorn is a secretive, merciless and fair deity. He has been known to command with a look and explains himself rarely. As dark and sinister as his powers may be, he does not abuse his power, in fact he only uses it whenever the balance of nature might be threatened. Otherwise he is content to watch and guide the other deities in the pursuit of nature's protection.
