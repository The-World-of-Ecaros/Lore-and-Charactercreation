Vinsc
=====

### Vines

Vinsc (Vine-sk) Sometimes hot, sometimes cold, much like the changing colors of the leaves. Vinsc is an unpredictable god. Calculating, temperamental and devious. The god of harvest is fickle, more so than any other. Providing abundance one year and scarcity the next. To appease him is difficult, to predict him, is impossible, in all but one way. He, like his colleagues, takes his duties to nature seriously and strives to keep it's balance.
