Vavren

### The Vay

Vavren (Vay-ren) Not all beings whom turn to good do so from a place of good, redemption is a difficult and sacrificial act. Many destroy themselves trying to attain it, many more lose their nerve and do not attain it. Vavren is the lord of redemption and guides those that seek to redeem themselves not just in the eyes of their peers but also in their own eyes. To admit weakness is a difficult thing, to truly change even more so. Although Vavren does not speak, he watches and commands plenty from his silent watch over the souls of mortals.
