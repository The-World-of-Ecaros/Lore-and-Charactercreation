The Seven
=========

### Sevenic

The Seven (The-7) Although recent to the pantheons of deities, no deity is perhaps more well respected by all pantheons, than the Seven, a band of mortals that rose up during the recent time of The Reckoning, striking down the greatest threat all creation ever knew, only to in the end, disappear from the world. No one knows why they are gone, nor where they have gone to, but all creatures whom carry the mantle of deity, give a fraction of their power to The Seven, as payment for what they have done. For the greatest gift, The Seven ever gave, was hope. Through out the mortal realm, shrines to them can be seen spreading this hope, the Seven statues ever vigilant, in case their enemy should ever return.
