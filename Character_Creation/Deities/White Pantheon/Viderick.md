### Vidians

Viderick (Vid-or-rick) Is it better to have love and lost, then to never have loved at all? There are many of those whom seek love and companionship. There are those that feel the sting of loss, the pain of grief, the cold grasp of despair. But these are things that can help us grow, for in that watered ground a new flower may bloom. Viderick is the guardian of love, the guide of grief and the lover of the lost.
