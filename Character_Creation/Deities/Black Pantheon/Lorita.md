### Loritas

Lorita (Lore-Rita) â€“ There are many stories of good triumphing over evil, that the orphaned child meets those that will love them, or grows up and loves another child with double the strength. Good endings are fairy tales; reality is far more brutal and unforgiving. It is said it was in one of these stories that Lorita was born. Her parents slaughtered before her eyes by the evil wizard Tyre. She was taken to an arcane laboratory, where she was sliced open, like the other children there, her essence drained slowly, her misery coalescing for the wizard's experiments. Each of the children were kept alive and kept young by the wizard's foul magics. It was here, in the years of the wizard's captivity that Lorita was born again. While the other children cried in despair, something within her changed, her essence begain to turn a deep red and over time, her misery turned to rage. It grew and grew, the magic from the essence of the others, unknown to Lorita, flowed within her. Then one day, when the wizard was complacent, Lorita screamed. She screamed so loud and with such fury that the wizard's magic faltered, the other children were drained to fuel her rage and the laboratory was destroyed. The wizard escaped, but so did Lorita. Now able to walk the world, she stole the wizard's secrets and made for herself a home within the plane of fire, where she still searches for the man that stole her life and lit her rage.
