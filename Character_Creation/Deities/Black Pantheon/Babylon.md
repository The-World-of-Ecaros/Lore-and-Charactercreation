Babylon
=======

### Binders

Babylon (Baa-bii-lon) Promises, obligations and guilt. The building blocks of society and the source of many powers. What most do not know is that there is a single deity, a being whose age is truly unknowable, in which all oaths are bound. All of them, from the child's promise to their parents to mind, to the drunkards attested boasts, to the paladin's holy vow, are regulated by a being known as Babylon. He has many names, The Man in Black, The First Devil, The Dark Prince. Many forms does he take, many masks he wears, but no matter what, they all come back to a single fact. The devil always gets his due.
