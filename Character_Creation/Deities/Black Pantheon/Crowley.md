### Elaka

Crowley (Kr-ow-ley) The Eldar are an ancient ever living race that have explored the outer planes. Since they do not ever expire naturally, the Eldar are extremely cautious for what purposes they commit themselves. One committed himself to battle, endless conflict and when his masochism grew stale, sought to make a weapon that could ever change and such, he could always have a new challenge. Crowley succeeded, what he made horrified the Eldar and as such Crowley was banished within a prison he could not escape from. This did not stop his creation. It festered, it infected, and it brought ruin to a world known as Azengolt, where even now the last stand of life, fights back the forces of the Depthar. Crowley did not rage in his imprisonment, but instead reveled in his creation and knew that one day he would escape and would see new challenges in which to test himself. His patience was finally rewarded, when a piece of his old text was recovered and the magic called him from his prison. When he arrived, he saw his summoner slain and he was unbound. He decided to reward those that fought so well with a few years of reprieve, but even now, the new Lord of Death takes up his mantle and prepares to find satisfaction in his new role, in this new world.
