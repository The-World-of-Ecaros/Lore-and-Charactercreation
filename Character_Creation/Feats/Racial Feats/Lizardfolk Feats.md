Lizardfolk Feats
================

| Blood Frenzy |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite: Lizardfolk_  Your thirst for blood can not be sated just once, you must feed more, you hunger for the taste of iron in your mouth.<br><br>* You can now use your Hungry Jaws ability once per turn.<br>* Whenever you critically hit with your Hungry Jaws ability, you gain temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your Constitution modifier instead of the normal amount. This only occurs while in the form of a Lizardfolk. |

| Primal Scale |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite: Kobold_  You are unlike the other weak, cowardly types of your race. You are strong. Powerful. Unfettered by they who would tower over you. You gain the following benefits:<br><br>* Remove the -2 to strength gained from your race. It becomes a +2 instead. |

| Serpent Exemplar |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite: Yuan-ti Pureblood_  Unlike others of your kind, you have adopted the more serpentine part of your heritage. You gain the following benefits:<br><br>* As an action you can transform yourself into a more serpent-like form; your legs meld together into that of a snake’s tail, though your upper half remains humanoid and does not change size. While in this form, your movement speed is reduced by 10 feet, but you gain a climb speed and a swim speed equal to your movement speed. You can remain in this form indefinitely, but you can only transform into serpent form or back to your normal form once per short or long rest. Any clothing, armor, or other equipment worn around your legs magically merge into the serpent form. This transformation does not function, nor can it be activated while under the effect of another polymorph ability.<br>* While in this form you can attempt to restrain one creature you have grappled with your tail. When you take the attack action you can make a special melee attack, a constrict on this grappled creature. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this Attack replaces one of them. Provided your tail is free, you can make an opposed grapple check against the creature with it. If you succeed, the target is grappled and restrained. The condition ends when the grapple ends.<br>* While in this form your fangs are a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike. If you hit with it, you deal piercing or poison damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier. |
