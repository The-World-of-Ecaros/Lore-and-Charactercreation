Skinwalker Feats
================

| Aerial Acuity |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite: Aarakocra_  You are unmatched in the air, and those beneath you shall be blinded by the radiance behind your wings. You gain the following benefits:<br><br>* You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and contested ability checks if you are at a higher elevation than the opponent.<br>* When flying outside and the sun is out, you can use the Hide action even without cover if you are at least 60 feet above those you are hiding from by taking advantage of the sunâ€™s position in the sky, and you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks as a part of this kind of hiding. This has no effect on creatures that do not rely on sight to perceive you.<br>* Darkvison: you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. |

| Agility of the Clawed |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite: Tabaxi_  Your agility is refined to a point that even others of your kind have difficulty matching your movements. You gain the following benefits:<br><br>* You gain proficiency with the Acrobatics, or Sleight of Hand skill.<br>* Whenever you would be knocked prone, you can instead use your reaction to not be knocked prone.<br>* You can use your claws as a finesse weapon which you are proficient in. You can make a melee attack with your claws as a bonus action. |

| Felicity |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite: Tabaxi_  Your feline reflexes allow you to escape from tricky situations with greater ease. You gain the following benefits:<br><br>* You can use your reaction to force an opponent that has hit you with a melee attack to reroll the attack and take the result of the reroll. You regain the use of this ability after a short or long rest, or when you roll initiative at the start of combat.<br>* Whenever you use your reaction, you can also use your Feline Agility trait to move up to half your speed as part of the reaction.<br>* You do not take damage from the first 60 feet of a fall, and you do not fall prone as a result of taking fall damage, as you always land on your feet. |

| Stolen Incantation |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite: Kenku_  Your mimicry teaches you not only how to mimic the words of others, but their incantations and spellcasting too. You gain the following benefit:<br><br>* Once per long rest, if you see a spell cast within 60 feet of you, you can cast that spell at the same level without expending a spell slot. The ability modifier for this type of spell casting is based on the creature you saw cast it. This ability cannot be used on spells higher than half you level. You can only use this trait if you have seen the spell cast within the past hour. Spells cast this way still require a verbal component, and you must still provide a material component that is expensive or is consumed upon use. |

| Wings of the Wind |
| --- |
| _Prerequisite:_ _Aarakocra_  You have become an expert in flight, and mastered maneuverability in the skies. You gain the following benefits:<br><br>* Increase your movement speed by 10 feet.<br>* Whenever you take the Dodge action while flying you gain temporary +1 AC. This lasts until the start of your next turn.<br>* As a bonus action, you can descend up to 500 feet without taking fall damage. If you take the attack action immediately after using this ability and descending by at least 40 feet, your next attack does an additional 2d6 damage. You can add this damage once per short or long rest, or whenever you would roll initiative. You cannot use this ability while grappling a creature or carrying a heavy load. |
