Crafting Feats
==============

### Master Enchanter

* You can craft magical tools, up to a +bonus equal to half your proficiency. Only you know how to use them, and only while you have this feat.
* You can add a second special attunement to a magic item.
* You can spend up to 500 gp with a crafting day to progress any magic item blueprint of yours by half the spent amount. You spend this gold in increments of a 100. Progression in this way doesn't destroy items for simultaneous item progression, and these rates spent for the crafting day are unaffected by all crafting progression modifiers. You cannot use this feature again until the next weekly reset.

### Master Scribe

* You have advantage on ability checks to use spell scrolls.
* Choose 5 spells up to 6th level from any spell list. The chosen list is permanent and cannot change with retraining. With Calligrapher's Supplies and spending the appropriate resources (time, gold, and material components), you can craft 1 spell scroll from your chosen list of a level equal to or less than your proficiency bonus. You use your scores for the spell ability modifier of the class the spell came from to determine DCs (10 + the spell ability modifier) and spell attack bonus (2 + the spell ability modifier). For example, crafting a scroll of Moonbeam would use your Wisdom to determine the DC. Only you can cast a scroll you've created this way. You cannot use this feature again until the next weekly reset.
* When you cast a spell scroll you've created yourself, its spell save DC and spell attack bonus is increased by 1.

### Master Chef

* When you craft a food token, you can choose to have one culinary benefit gained from it that gives a limited voluntary use to have the number of those uses increased by 2. This only affects one food token you've created. You cannot use this feature again until the next weekly reset.
* The duration of culinary benefits from food tokens you create is doubled.
* When you cook a meal with mid rest cooking, you can choose a second culinary benefit to apply.

### Master Chymist

* When you forage for a reagent, you can choose to forgo rolling the ability check and instead treat the roll of the d20 as a 15. You cannot use this feature again until the next weekly reset.
* If you drink a potion you've created yourself, its duration is increased by half. This doesn't apply to oils.
* If you use a poison you've created yourself, its DC is increased by 1 and it bypasses a creature's resistance to poison damage.
