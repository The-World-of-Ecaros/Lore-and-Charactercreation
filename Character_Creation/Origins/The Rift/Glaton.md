Gla'ton
=======

Gla'ton, one of the eight cities of the Taladoni, was a place of learning that studied the soul itself, graveyards were bound spirits of loved ones, that would visit thier living relatives and they themselves that lived beneath the city. This knowledge of the soul contorts those that venture too close.  The soul is empowered. **+1 to Wisdom**  The whispers of spirits cause words to fail. **Denied skill - Persuasion**
