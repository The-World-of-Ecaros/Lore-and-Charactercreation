Priend
======

_Priend, one of the eight cities of the Taladoni, is a place of art and music where one can find the highest forms of culture. Those that venture too close will find themselves consumed by the magic therein.  The music causes your body to dance with grace. The colors and the sounds are enough for one to lose focus._
