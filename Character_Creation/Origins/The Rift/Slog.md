Slog
====

Slog, one of the eight cities of the Taladoni, is a place where the automative magic of the Taladoni is paramount, stone servants perform nearly every task and the degenerate and despot nature of those that live there is reflected through the magic of those that come too close.  The power of command is based on ones words. **+1 Charisma**  Such luxury has left you.. lacking in vital areas. **Denied Skill - Athletics**
