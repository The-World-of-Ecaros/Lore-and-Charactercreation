No matter what you might call yourself, some were just born to fight. These Baymen are the ones that rise to be truly great, proving themselves in combat and dominating the seas. Not only hunting landwalkers but other Baymen as well, these Baymen are the alphas on the sea.  You were dealt a cruel hand in your beginning, always having to scrape by, you knew one day you would be great and you knew how to take it. You trained in the sword, you hardened your body and now you take your glory!
