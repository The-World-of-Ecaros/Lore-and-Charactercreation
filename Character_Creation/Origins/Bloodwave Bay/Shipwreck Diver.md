Shipwreck Diver
===============

_Sometimes the life of hunting those on the waters isn’t nearly as profitable or as easy as scavenging the sea floor. There are those that brave the depths and the train their bodies rigorously in order to dive to the bottom of the sea, searching for hidden and lost treasures.  
 You were one of these brave divers. You scoured the deep and have seen things most don’t even know exist. You have adapted to your underwater environment.  
 You have spent so long under the water that its depths are like a second home._
