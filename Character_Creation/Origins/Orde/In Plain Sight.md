In Plain Sight
==============

The Ordeans believe that they are safe and sound, just and right within their white walls and atop their marble cliffs. How little they know. For the unwelcome churches have made their home within and around these walls, hiding in plain sight. Those that whisper to the dark ones. Receive the blessings they need in order to survive.  You have walked in deceit and shadow your entire life. Fake smiles and prayers are the masks you wear in order to further your goals. You are rather good at it. You reveal your nature to only those you trust the most, for if word got out of what you are, terrible things would happen. In order to find others hiding within plain sight all you must do is speak the secret words. “The sun sets.” If they are truly one of you they shall simply answer “The night begins”. (The above will be changed to match deities at another time)  **You choose a warlock cantrip. You may cast it at character level.  Skill Prof – Deception**
