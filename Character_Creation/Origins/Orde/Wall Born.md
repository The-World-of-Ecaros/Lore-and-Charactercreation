Wall Born
=========

_The great wall of Orde, holds back the denizens of the badlands and the watchers on the wall, keep a close eye upon the horizon. So large is the wall, that it could be considered a city in its own right, harboring thousands of soldiers and their families, it is easily the largest military application in Ecaros. Those that are born here learn of the dark things within the badlands and are taught vigilance, to ensure they are always ready.  The vigilance of the wall guard is legendary._
