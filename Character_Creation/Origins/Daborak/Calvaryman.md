Calvaryman
==========

Daborak's military might is respected Ecaros-wide. However, it is their Calvary, that make them feared. You have spent years training as one of these powerful dragoons. Even if your path takes you elsewhere, you have been versed in the art of breaking through battle lines and running your opponents down.  **Skill Prof â€“ Martial**  Although your path might take you elsewhere, your time with the calvary will stay with you. **You gain a +1 to melee attack rolls whenever you would move at least 20ft or more before the attack. If you possess the Charger feat, this bonus is increased to +2.**
