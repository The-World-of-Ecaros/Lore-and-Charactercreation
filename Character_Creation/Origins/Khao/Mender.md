Mender
======

_Due to the constant wear and tear of the Jungle on structures, those that are able to repair are in high demand. Whether you're a bespectacled alchemist carefully measuring fuel deposits or a simple basket weaver repairing a thatched roof, both have the calling to fix things.  You can fix anything given enough time!_

You know the Mending cantrip, except you can cast it as an action, and at character level.  You gain proficiency in the Investigation skill, and with Tinker's Tools.
