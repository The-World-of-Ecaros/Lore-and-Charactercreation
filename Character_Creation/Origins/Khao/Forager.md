Forager
=======

_Foragers often serve their tribe or ship as the healer and consumable expert. Using their potent training, they can create potions to heal and poisons to harm easily. They keep watch over those in their care and see to it that the wounded might see another day and their enemy does not.  Herbs and minerals are powerful tools in your hands. Whether in the whispers of the sky or the growls of the jungle, those that rest in your care face the morning more refreshed._

When you use a healing kit to stabilize a creature, you restore 1d4 hit points to that creature. If you use the action from the Healer feat, you heal the target for an additional 1d10 hit points.  You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, and with Alchemist's Supplies.
