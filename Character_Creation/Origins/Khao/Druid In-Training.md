Druid In-Training
=================

_Whether it be in the sky or within the jungle, Druids find these frontiers a training ground for new recruits. The fury of nature is evident to these individuals and often they are drawn to protect and wield the power of nature. Whether or not you become a druid, their power stays with you.  You may have taken another path, but the power of the druid and their secrets stay with you, and you are attuned with the animals of the wild._
