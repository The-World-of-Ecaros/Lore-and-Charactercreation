Lowlander
=========

Not every Krazaxian lives within the mountains, some choose to live in the bountiful fields of the lowlands. The lowlands provide the main supply of food for all of Krazax, therefore lowlanders are known to be well fed and strong.  You have lived your entire life in the shadow of the mountains. Always looking up at them, like stone sentinels watching over you, you have toiled the land and found a sense of peace in it.  Dwarven influence, plus a well fed upbringing has made you inappropriately hardy.
