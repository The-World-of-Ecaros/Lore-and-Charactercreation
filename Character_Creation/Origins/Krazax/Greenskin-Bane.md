Greenskin-Bane
==============

Krazax is the home to the Dwarfs, but also to their ancient enemies of goblin-kind. Goblin kind mostly consists of Goblins, Orcs, Hob-Goblins and Bugbears. There are many types of these creatures and there are those whose hatred of these creatures is so intense, they dedicate themselves to their eradication.  Some might call you a zealot, some haven’t seen what goblins are truly capable of. Sure, some might be redeemable and you would never harm someone who is an official citizen. But some, are just plain evil. You are ready to end them.  Your hatred of goblin-kind runs deep. **You gain a +3 to attack rolls vs creatures of the greenskin subtype.  Skill Prof – Nature**
