Forgechild
==========

_The forges of Krazax are responsible for some of the most magnificent creations ever seen in all of Ecaros. From weapons and armor to buildings and bridges to even the smallest nail. Each creation from Krazax is done by masterful hands of great forge families. Whose clanâ€™s heritage goes back almost as far as the mountains.  You were born under this pedigree, a craftsman by birth and with the forge in your veins, even if you never showed interest, the skills are there waiting to be used. You were raised around the forge fire. You know its rings and falls all too well._
