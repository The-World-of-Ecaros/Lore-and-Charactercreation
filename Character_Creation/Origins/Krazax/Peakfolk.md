Peakfolk
========

Peakfolk are a curious lot, living high above their Krazaxian brothers in barely hospitable and incredibly dangerous areas of the mountains, they still manage to stake out a living. The Peakfolk are more isolated than perhaps any other kind of Krazaxian, as they rarely come down from their lofty peaks. Their monasteries are some of the most enlightened in the world, many philosophers and monks make pilgrimages to these lofty heights. In the hope their understanding might be expanded.  You have looked down from your high perch since you were young. No sense of fear but instead of wonder. The entire world opens out in front of you, your eyes straining far to the tips of the land, the clouds floating just out of reach.  To fall would be… undesirable.
