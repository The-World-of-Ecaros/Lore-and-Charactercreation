Twice Cursed
============

_There are those that are considered ill omens among the hopeless. These Twice-Cursed walk with more than their fair share of the curse. Powerful nightmares await them each night and sleep often eludes them. However, within this horrible existence there lies a silver lining. For the more cursed they become, the more powerful they get._
