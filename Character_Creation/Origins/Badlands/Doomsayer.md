Doomsayer
=========

Dark utterings and whispered warnings plague denizens of the badlands. Some are afflicted worse than others, and these voices pour like a diseased river from the Doomsayer with uncontrolled extremity. Those around them are effected with the endless mutterings.  **Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll, saving throw or skill check in combat, you are healed for a number of hitpoints equal to your Constitution modifier (The heal takes place after the effect of the roll, e.g you miss and then you are healed, not before.).**
