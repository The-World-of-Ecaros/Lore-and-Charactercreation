Woeful Warrior
==============

Sadness can overpower and cripple. Hence why it makes such a potent weapon. Those that dedicate themselves to this vicious art, are feared not for their blade, but for what they leave behind. Misery in an already unhappy world.  **Whenever you kill an enemy, you are healed for a number of hitpoints equal to the killed enemy's Constitution modifier (minimum one).**
