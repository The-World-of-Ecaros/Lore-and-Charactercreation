Wendigo Soul
============

Those born while their mothers are eaten by their fathers, birth the Wendigo Soul. The survival of such a child, a miracle, the life of the adult a curse.  **Whenever an enemy you can see within 10ft rolls a 1 on a d20 roll, you are healed for 3 hit points as you feed on the misfortune of others.**
