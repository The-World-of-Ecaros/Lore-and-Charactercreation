The Path of the Scion
=====================

The arcane is a natural place for power and the ambitious, the Shar'kai are no different. Those that take the path of the arcanist are refered to as Scions. They use the knowledge granted by the three rivers and the salt within to create concoctions to expand ones mind. Such things lead to the discovery of the Eldar gates that would eventually allow the exiles to escape their home of Elda'sharkai  You gain an additional use of the **Glory of Aladine** before you must rest.  Whenever you benefit from the **Glory of Aladine**, the next spell you cast has it's DC increased by 2.
