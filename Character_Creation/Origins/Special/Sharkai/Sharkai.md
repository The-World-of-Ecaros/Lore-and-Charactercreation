Shar'kai
========

The Shar'kai journeyed in exile from their home of Elda'sharkai, crossing through one of the ancient eldar gates and have entered the continent of Kalakatesh, bringing with them an alien culture. A culture that views death in a different light, the struggles of life forged nearly all Shar'kai into ambitious, merciless warriors, who will not hesitate to destroy what is before them. The Shar'kai that traveled with Cor Cy Ael, have left behind only one piece of their culture, their religion in Aladine. Branded as heretics, due to the belief that the god of death had died, they left in exile to seek freedom in another land.  **Special Rule** – All Shar'kai must take this Origin. This rule may change dependent on time and world events.   Shar'kai's ambitions are versatile and they either excel or perish in their culture. **You gain a +1 to any ability score of your choice.**  All Shar'kai are warriors from their tests in youth. **You gain Skill Prof – Martial**  The following are Sub-Origins available to the Shar'kai
