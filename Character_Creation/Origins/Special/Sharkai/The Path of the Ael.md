The Path of the Ael
===================

Some Shar'kai choose the path of the Ael, furthering their starting warriors training to become one of the hallowed servants of Aladine, a knight in the common tongue. Even though they have left behind their religion, the Shar'kai of Aekrath keep true to the tenets of the Ael and use them to overwhelm any foe foolish enough to face them.  You gain an additional use of the **Glory of Aladine** before you must rest.  Whenever you use the **Glory of Aladine**, you may make an attack with your weapon against another creature that is within 30ft of you as a bonus action.
