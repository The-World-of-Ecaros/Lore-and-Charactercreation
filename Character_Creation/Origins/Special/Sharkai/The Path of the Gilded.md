The Path of the Gilded
======================

Trade in Elda'sharkai is just as much as a war as the battlefield is. Those Ael that choose the market as their place to fight, they wear a set of earrings, shining with decoration to mark them as one of the gilded.  You gain an additional use of the **Glory of Aladine** before you must rest.  Those that walk the path of the Gilded are more versatile in their skill sets and therefore gain proficiency in a skill of their choice.
