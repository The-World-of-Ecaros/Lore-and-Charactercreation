The Path of the Forsaken
========================

The Shar'kai who pursued the tenets of Aladine, were shattered into two factions when he was defeated. Those that followed Cor Cy Ael to Aekrath, were branded as forsaken, the worst of the heretics. However, the power of their divinity is still pulsing within.  You gain an additional use of the **Glory of Aladine** before you must rest.  Whenever you benefit from the **Glory of Aladine**, you may heal all of your allies within 30ft as well as yourself.
