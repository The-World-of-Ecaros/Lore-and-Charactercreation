Guild Born
==========

_The mages guild is a massive influence on the events in Ecaros. Their power rivals that of any country, indeed Majital itself is just a staging ground for the guild. Those born within its confines, children or otherwise dependents of its various member, possess a myriad of privileges that others can hardly imagine.  You have experienced the closest thing to a noble within Majital. Being a Guild Born means that your parents, guardian or someone within the guild is watching out for you. This means you started with a bit of an edge.  The influence of the mages guild is massive, and wealth has its privileges. You are wealthier than most realize._
