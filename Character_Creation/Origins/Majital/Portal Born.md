Portal Born
===========

There are those that have outsider blood within them and their are some that simply traveled too far. Perhaps their parents were wayward wizards, perhaps they were the results of some strange experiment. Whatever the case, these strange few simply appeared one day in front of the great planar portals in Majital. They, regardless of race, are just a little different.  You have always known you were a little different than others. Strange things tend to happen around you and even the magically aware people of Majital, keep their distance.  You were touched of another plane, as such, its influence can be seen within you. **Choose one of the following damage types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder. You reduce the damage you take from that damage type by 3. This is specifically applied after resistance.  Skill Prof â€“ Religion**
