Sand Strider
============

There are those that abscond with living in the so called civilized world of Majital and instead prefer the freedom of the desert. The desert holds many secrets and truths, the largest truth being the amount of trade available on the great roads through the desert. For those few that would brave the journey, many gifts await them.  You have traveled these roads and have been to many places. Without people like you the people of Majital would go without so many of their conveniences. Many might see you as scavengers and peddlers, perhaps not to be respected as much as the merchants of magic. That may be true, but there will always be a need for the humble trader, after all, magic isn’t everything. Some things it cant find, but you can.  Being so well traveled has led you to inherent some additional benefits when traveling. **You don't need to sleep, but can instead meditate similar to an elf for 4 hours, gaining the benefit of an 8 hour rest. If you are also an elf, you reduce the time to 2 hours.  Skill Prof – Survival**
