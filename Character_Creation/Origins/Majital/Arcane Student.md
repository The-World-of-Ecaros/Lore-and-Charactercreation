The study of the Arcane may seem like the purpose of the few, but in Majital, all children receive a rudimentary magical education. Their are a few that take this education further than the basics. Even if they have no intention of being spellcasters. These few who take it as far as they are able, are respected among thier peers regardless of their calling. Indeed they use these lessons to strive themselves to further greatness.  You are an arcane student, even if you study abroad, your thirst for the knowledge of the arcane drives you. While it may not be your main passion, it is constantly in your shadow, guiding you in your career.  Your training in the arcane translates into other professions more easily than most. **You receive skill proficiency in two other skills of your choice.**  Every student has that one spell that stands out to them. You were no different. **Choose a single wizard cantrip, you cast that at character level.**
