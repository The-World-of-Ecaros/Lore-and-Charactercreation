Majital
=======

Majital is abundant in two things. Sand and Magic. This desert country although lacking in natural resources, makes up for this by being the home of the wizards guild. Majitalians are a people who value knowledge, ambition and privacy. Their cunning nature is matched only by the beauty of their darkened skin. Majitalians all possess the following abilities as well as a choice of sub-type.  To some magic is a calling, but to a Majitalian, it is apart of everyday life. Majitalians begin play with **Detect Magic as an at will ability.** This functions as the spell in all other respects. **You also have proficiency in the Arcana skill.  +1 Intelligence**
