Giant Slayer
============

Giants are a commonplace occurrence in Steton, in fact many of them are citizens. However, most giants are not and are hunted for their skin and the large hoards the tend to collect. Most are fought by the few Stetonians that wish to test themselves against the might of such cunning and organized creatures. Considering that many giants turn to banditry, Giant Slayers are considered almost patriotic in their approach.  You are one of these guardians of the wild. You have hunted and traded with giant-kind during your formative years and as such you have developed a few tricks to adapt.  You have received training similar to that of Dwarfs and gnomes to combat these creatures. **You ignore the extra reach of creatures larger than you.  Skill Prof â€“ History**
