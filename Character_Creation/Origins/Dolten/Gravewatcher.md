Gravewatcher
============

_Gravewatch is a city built on the precipice of an ancient battle in Doltenâ€™s history. The Crimson Citadel sits as a lonely testament to the lives lost on this ancient battlefield. So large was the death toll, that this mass grave was never scoured, bodies never returned, souls trapped within the land. As such the landscape changed and adapted to this necrotic host.  You were born here, in this city of mourning, where the dead rising is a common and dangerous occurrence. As such you have attained abilities to live and thrive among the dead._
