Dolten
======

Dolten is a land wrought with danger and darkness. Nevertheless, there are those that make their home here. Living side by side with the dark things that go bump in the night. Thriving within the dark forest, the Abhorrent Arboreal. All Doltenians receive the following benefits and may choose a sub Origin for additional abilities.  Having lived in fear, Doltenians are much harder to scare. **You gain a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. Fear effects.**  A Doltenian has a strong mind. **+1 Wisdom**  Darkness lives within a Doltenian's soul. This taint marks them and empowers them. Each of the sub origins presents a **+1 to an ability score** but also a **burden** the character must carry.
