Ward of Witchtown
=================

_Life in the big city depends on the city. Witchtown is the capital of Dolten and is the most secure in its place among the trees. Ruled by the council of the tower, the denizens of Dolten live in relative safety and prosperity. However, like all places in Dolten, Witchtown has its secrets.  Being an orphan in Witchtown means you were taken care of by the state and as such, you were exposed to many things in the slums of this city. Exposed to terrors most are unaware of, the biggest being the Witches who truly rule Witchtown and all of Dolten. They took you in, fed you, clothed you. They also showed you dark truths and darker powers. As such, you were a Ward of Witchtown, the closest thing to a noble in Dolten. A true noble that is.  You have had several dark mothers raise you, and through them, you are well connected. You see the world in many different ways, and you know not to trust things as they seem._
