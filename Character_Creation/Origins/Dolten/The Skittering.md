The Skittering
==============

_Those that live within the Webwood have respect and fear for the spider. To some, this may seem silly, but those who have witnessed the Creeping Deathâ€™s terrible fury, know otherwise.  You were born here in these woven woods. Staking out a living from the thread left behind by The Creeping Death. As frightening as it may seem, the living is quite profitable as the clothing tailored from it, all the world demands. Throughout your life, you have found a way to survive by timing, caution and respecting the spider.  You always keep a look out for spiders, as spider silk is rare and sells for quite the profit._
